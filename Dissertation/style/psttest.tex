If this document has compiled and the simple two-taxon tree looks okay, then the \textsf{PSTricks} installation on your system is adequate for using the \textsf{newicktree} package.

If the file compiles but the tree does not appear correctly, then it is possible that you are viewing a dvi file.  Please convert your dvi file to a PostScript file (preferrably using dvips), and try viewing that.

\pstree{\Tdot}{\skiplevel[levelsep=1]{\Tdot~{Node 1}}\skiplevel[levelsep=1.5]{\Tdot~{Node 2}}}
