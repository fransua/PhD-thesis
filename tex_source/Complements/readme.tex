Some particularities about this thesis:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The glossary}: some words are underlined with dotted lines like  \dotuline{this}. A short definition of these words can be found in the \hyperref[theglossary]{Glossary}. The page numbers for all occurrences of the defined word appear at the end of each definition.
\item \textbf{The bibliography}: the bibliography is quite standard. In the text references appear between square brackets [like this]. In the \hyperref[thebibliograhy]{Bibliography}, the number of authors listed  is limited to 15. The page numbers corresponding to citations of references in the main text appear at the end of each reference (for example, [Alonso \textit{et al.} 2006] cited 3 times: {\footnotesize $\hookrightarrow$ \textit{pages 10, 66 and 69}}).
\end{itemize}
