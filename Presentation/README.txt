=====

Over this presentation I will review the three main chapter of the thesis, mentioned in the title.
 * About the informational content of the genomes, their random-like structure.
 * For the ecological aspect, I will present the work we completed around the ecology of genetic elements
 * And finally I will review the advances we propose in pour genomic study of selective pressures acting in functionally related group of genes.

First I will do a little introduction around the concept of neutrality in evolution.

Classification of evolutionary changes
======================================

Evolutionary changes are changes that affect the inherited characteristics of a biological population.

This changes are not directional, they appear randomly in population. And it is evolution that may accept or reject them through the elimination or rise of given individuals.

According to the influence of natural selection over changes, we can classify them in three categories:
 * advantageous changes, that may give a reproductive advantage to the individuals carrying them. They may improve their fitness.
 * deleterious changes, that, just in the opposite, are affecting negatively the fitness of individuals. Individuals carrying them may be pushed by natural selection to disappear from populations.
 * and finally, the neutral changes, that represent the narrow area segregating advantageous and deleterious changes. Neutral changes may not affect the fitness of an organism and thus, may escape from natural selection.

4%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Importance of neutral changes in molecular evolution
====================================================

 * Since the definition of neutral changes by Charles Darwin in the origin of species, their importance was believed to be negligible.
The global view of the major selective forces acting on evolutionary changes was the selectionist view, where we have only 2 categories of changes, deleterious, and advantageous changes, here shown in the picture in purple  and green.
   - At the time, very few opposition to this view was presented. We can mention Sewall Wrights point of view, that discussed the importance of random moves, associated to neutral changes, in the race bringing species into states of higher fitness.
 * This view was finally seriously challenged by the advent of the first molecular data, and the first empirical estimation of mutation rate (1 substitution per 2 generation). why?
    - mainly because of the work conducted by Haldane on the cost of natural selection, in which he estimated the number of selective death necessary for the spreading of an advantageous allele in a population. This estimation led to the establishment of an upper limit in the number of selective mutations a species can afford (1 per 300 generation).
    - this estimation, together with the estimation of the first real mutation rate led two independent groups to propose the neutral theory of molecular evolution. Namely Jack Lester King and Thomas H. Jukes and Motoo Kimura. Under this new theory the importance of neutral changes passed from negligible to preponderant. Under the neutral theory the general scheme of the relative importance of selective forces passed to be as shown here in the picture. Wit most of the changes, not deleterious being neutral.
    - Finally, some years after Tomoko Ohta, that was originally working with Kimura, proposed the nearly neutral theory of neutral evolution. This theory brought a new category of selective pressure classifying some changes as being "nearly neutral". This light modification account basically to the effect of population size on the proportion of changes retained.

In any way, neutral theory is now a days completely accepted and the statistical model derived from it are able to detect precisely the effect of natural selection on genomes.

Neutrality in Ecology I
=======================

Now that we have seen the outcome of the neutral theory in the context of molecular evolution, I will do a little introduction about the state of neutral thinking in Ecology. In particular in the study of the distribution of species in ecosystems.

 * In this kind of  studies, the identification of the action of natural selection passed through the definition of ecological niches. Species may have unique niches unless in the context of cooperating species or non interacting species. In the picture on the left, we can see the evolution of two species that have overlapping niches with similar level of fitness. Here, in A we can see this initial state. with, in blue and green, each species, the fitness is represented in the Y and the niche occupancy is represented in the X axis. As we can see, niches are overlapping. And this overlapping may be negative for both species unless they are not interacting or they are cooperating to access to the resources or to escape from predators. This kind of interaction were included in niche based models.
 * However early in the study of ecosystems several statistician proposed statistical models able to explain greatly the pattern of distribution of species in an ecosystems. We can mention Motomura, Fisher or Preston that used different statistical models, respectively the geometric series, the log series and the log-normal, to describe the relative species abundance in ecosystems. Here we can see their representation in different colors. This plot is a typical plot used by ecologists. In the x axis are represented each species sampled, ranked by their abundance, the first species on the left will be the more abundant and the last on the right, the more rare. In the Y is represented the abundance of each species in relation to the overall number of individuals in the ecosystems. The first species may represent a high percentage of total sample, while last species represent often less than 1% of the individuals in the ecosystem. And thus this statistical models were able to replicate quite accurately the pattern of distribution of species in the ecosystem.
    - Actually in order to have an idea of the shape of real ecosystems, here is a relative species abundance curve for different forests from tropical forests with more species, temperate forests and finally Boreal forests with very few species. With their different shapes, all adjusting to log-normal with optimized means and standard deviations.
 * This statistical models were early able to describe the patterns observed in nature but the elucidation of the neutral process that seemed to underlie this pattern had to wait until the 20th century with the formulation of a neutral model by Stephen Hubbell.

6%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Neutrality in Ecology II
========================
Hubbell's neutral model takes directly advantages of the advances of neutral models in population genetics, and more particularly of Ewens's sampling formula. The application of this model to different ecosystems revealed that the great majority of them were following the expectation of neutral moves.

 * The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography (untb) is based in only 2 free parameters, theta - or fundamental biodiversity number for the species behaviour (that accounts for both, the birth and death rate) and m for the migration rate. Even in simple neutral model migration rate can be fixed (m=1).

7%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Overview
========
I will now start with the presentation of the three first chapter of the thesis. Each of this chapter represents the study of genomes under different perspectives, and in each case we have try to frame our observations into a neutral model, or, at least to find some clues about this neutral frame.
 * This is the case for the first chapter, where no neutral frame is yet defined. Under this perspective, we analyze genomes as simple strings of the letters ACGT. Under this view, we achieved to define a common structure of all genomes analyzed and show are they are characterized by a universal quasi-random structure.
 * Ecological: here we focus in families of genetic elements of eukaryotic genomes. And, in order to study their dynamics we decided to assimilate them to biological species and to use ecological models to test their neutral pattern behind their composition.
 * Finally we will raise our level of observation to group of genes working together to accomplish a biological function or a metabolic pathway. Here, we developed a new strategy in order to reveal the effect of natural selection at this level of study.

8%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Adaptive raise in organism complexity
=====================================

 * Darwinian evolution does not encompass for directional change or global adaptive advances. However, in the context of biological complexity it may be hard to envisage raises in complexity without a certain amount of directionality. For example if we look at the tree scheme in the right, starting from the last universal common ancestor in green, if we follow the edges bringing to fungi, plants or vertebrates, the gain in complexity is undeniable. The number of cell types or the morphology of organism seem to have been evolving straight to higher levels of organization. However this hypothesis is still very difficult to test rigorously, and so far no hypotheses has significantly taken over in the scientific community.
 * The main problem stands undoubtedly in the definition of biological complexity, the number of countable levels of organization, cell types, systems or organs in an organism may be fuzzy and discontinuous kind of variables. However, if we focus on genomes we may think of a kind of approximation by expecting that the level of complexity should be proportional to the quantity of hereditary information.

9%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Challenging the C-value paradox
===============================

 * And this is the kind of expectations that pushed to calculate the total amount of DNA contained in species with different level of biological complexity. This measure of DNA content is called the C-value and is basically proportional to the weight of haploid genomes.
 * Even if the first analysis of this kind led to the finding of some correlation between genome size and biological complexity, with the extension of the measures to more and more species, this correlation was unanimously rejected. This absence of correlation is referred to as the C-value paradox.
 * In the plot in the left we can see an example of its expression. In the X is the log C-value, and the biological complexity is raising from bottom to top. From uni-cellulars to vertebrates. The first striking ting in this plot is the coverage of each clades. We can see how Protozoa C-values are covering more than 5 orders of magnitudes, or insects and crustaceans more than 3 order of magnitudes. Also looking at more distant species, we see that genomes of birds are smaller than the ones of gymnosperms.
 * This lack of correlation raises important component questions:
   - What are the types and proportions of non-coding DNA in eukaryotic genomes
   - from where this non-coding DNA is coming, and how is it spread or lost in genomes
   - Do they have any biological function and what are their function?
   - Why and how species with similar levels of complexity have such difference in proportion of non-coding DNA?
* In the context of this thesis we summarized this questions into two main topics:
   - the search for patterns in the informational content of genomes, in order to understand better the differences in amount of DNA observed.
   - and the dynamics underlying the distribution of the different types of non-coding DNA in the genomes.

and these two points constitutes the first two chapters of the thesis.

10%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Informational content
=====================

 * This first part of the presentation will than focus on a way to normalize genome size. Because as we have just seen, direct measures of genomes seem to carry an important component of noise. We believe that working instead with informational content would be able to stress some universal pattern for living species.
 * As we are going to see, the informational content that we define, corresponds basically to the genome size negatively weighted by its amount of non-informative or repetitive sequences. Or to make simple, it is comparable  to the size that would have the file genome dot zip.
 * And indeed, this measure is based in classical algorithms used in data compression.
 * For this work we took advantage of a large array of sequenced species and applied our algorithm to 54 species covering the whole diversity of life.

11%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The Genome or chromosome Complexity value
=========================================

Than, how do we compute the complexity value of a given sequence. This one for example.
 * The calculation consists in 3 steps:
    - first we compute the burrows wheeler transform of the sequences, that will help us to identify repetitive patterns. We take our example sequence and generate a list of new sequences that are successive rotations of the original one. Here the first one, is the original one, and the second is the same but the first character was placed at the end. This is repeated until the accomplishment of the full rotation. Once this is done, we order all the sequences in alphabetic order and define as output of the BWT the last character of each sequence, thus we have the last character of the first sequence "G", of the second sequence "A", of the third (number two), here, a "T"... etcera. In this new list of characters we would find consecutively several times the same character in the case of repetitive sequences. In this case the pattern found seems to be quite random.
 * The second step consists in transforming this characters in a single list of numbers representing the local correlation between successive characters. And this again in order to stress out some patterns found in the original sequence. And it work like this, we define the list of all possible characters in our sequence (GATC), and this the index of each character in it. Here the first G is the first character in the list, we then store a zero. Next, the A is the second character in the list, we store one, and we change our list in order to "move to front" the A, we put the A in the first position for the next iteration. Next we have a T, that is in third position in the new list, we store 2. We move the T to the front. And so on, the C here is in last position, we store 3. We end up with a list of number representing this local correlations in the search for repetitive patterns done by the BWT.
 * In order to summarize this list of values to one, we finally use the shannon entropy. And this is our complexity ratio. It scales up to 1, 1 being the value that would have perfectly random sequences, and would also represent the maximum content of information a sequence can carry.
 * As mentioned, we applied this algorithm on whole genomes and chromosomes of 54 species with genome sizes ranging from 1.6Kb to 3.4Gb.

12%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Complexity Value of genomes
===========================

And this is our result. In this plot, in the X we have the log genome size, and in the Y the log Complexity Value (that is the complexity ratio multiplied by the genome size). And here are plotted the genomes, as I said we have here 54 species, from viruses to mammals, and between we can see archeas bacterias fungus, protists, amebozoa, Caenorhabditis, Invertebrates, plants and Bryophyta, and finally the vertebrates fishes birds and mammals. And in some cases we pay attention in selecting species with wired genomes, like endosymbionts bacterias with reduced genomes or even this synthetic bacteria, and within the invertebrates we selected this newly sequenced Daphnia pulex famous for its amount of gene duplications.
 * The first striking point in this plot is this almost perfect correlation of one to one between genome size and the complexity value. With a R square of 0.9997, with almost no species distant from this correlation line, we just can see Zea mays, and in a minor proportion Sorghum.
Than, in order to challenge a bit this result, and to emphasize the deviations from the maximum complexity,  we decided to use the normalized complexity value, it is the complexity value divided by the genome size, or the complexity ratio.

13%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Complexity Ratio of genomes
===========================

And this is what we obtained. In the X we still have the log genome size, but in the Y we represent now the complexity ratio, that is ranging from 0 to 1. 1 being for sequences, genomes with the higher informational content. as we can see, this representation highlights the deviations from the maximum informational content.
 * in order to understand better the signification of these values we played a bit with random sequences. As I said before, random sequences should have a value of complexity ratio of 1, and simulate the maximum informational content of a genome. So, this is what we obtain with random sequences of different lengths, from 100Kb to 100Mb, we see how this sequences all have complexity values of exactly 1. We also wanted to see what happened if we duplicate this random sequences in order to simulate a WGD. And this is what we see here with the first star 2X that corresponds to the random sequence of 100Mb duplicated, and the corresponding CR is here just below 0.8, we repeated this by copying the random sequence 3, 4, 5 and 6 time, and we can see how the CR is falling. This values are important in order to understand better the values observed for genomes.
 * Lets go back to our genomes. Here our distribution of genome sizes, and som clades here. This is a bit more heterogeneous than with complexity value (this perfect correlation we saw). The main clades are placed as shown here with specific deviations in each cases. Phages and viruses really close to the maximum informational content, Archea and Bacteria really close to 1 also, with perhaps one strange case for this bacteria of small genome, Plant presenting the largest range of complexity ratio falling down to 0.6, fishes also variable and finally mammals really close to 1.
So, globally species have genomes with maximal informational content, but in some cases, species seem carry a proportion of repetitive sections in their genomes that would lower their CR, this is the case clearly for some plants here. In order to study specifically these cases, we looked at species with a CR lower than 0.95.
 * The red line here, we have 10 cases over the 54 species studied, let see what could be the reasons of this fall in complexity ratio.
 * Lets start with plants briophytes and fishes. The common characteristic of these species here is that they are all ancient polyploids, thus presenting higher level of genomic redundancy. The most striking case here is certainly Mays this recent tetraploid that has a genomic redundancy a bit lower than the 3 times repeated random sequence.
 * However Being polyploid is not the unique actor influencing the value of CR. As an example here if we look at the close related Arabidopsis thaliana and A. lyrata that both suffered the same WGD, while the first has a CR of around 0.98 the second has a CR of 0.93. This difference occurring in only 10 Myrs may be due to the drastic genome reduction of A. thaliana. Indeed we can see here how its genome is almost half the size of A. lyrata.
 * An other case of organism with low CR is D. pulex, this crustacean that undergoes an explosive gene expansion through gene duplications, leading to almost 40 thousand genes packed in its small genome.


14%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Complexity Ratio of chromosomes
===============================

 * We repeated the same analysis we chromosomes, and again we found a very correlation between genome size and complexity value. In the case of the complexity ratio plotted here, 75% of the chromosomes presented a complexity ratio higher than 0.95 and the median found was very high, around 0.97-0.98.
 * As before the outliers in this plot were polyploid genomes, specifically mays, sorghum and zebrafish. And the eukaryotic genomes with higher proportions of AT.
 * globally CR values for chromosomes were fond to be higher than for genomes, this might be related to the distribution of repetitive sequences, that the algorithm can identify only when looking at the whole genome.

15%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Hypotheses
==========

With these results, and after the validation process explained in the thesis, we proposed some hypotheses regarding the evolution of genome size and its informational content:
 * Non-polyploid organisms share a universal feature that is the quasi-random combinatorial structure of their DNA.
 * Moreover, polyploid organism are strongly attracted to a state of maximal complexity in their DNA structure. The increase in CR occur as a function of time.
 * As we state a quasi random combinatorial structure of DNA, if we want the genomes to increase in complexity, the only way is through DNA amplification followed by divergence of duplicated regions.

Nevertheless we need to state some specific cases where these hypotheses might be nullified.
 * this is the case for recent polyploids that have undergone a fast genome reduction, and recovered the quasi-random DNA-structure. skipping thus the divergence of duplicates.
 * Also, and this might be more a methodological issue. Regarding some genomes that are evidencing low CR that might be responding to strong bias in the GC content.
