## Abstract

This thesis is about the analysis of complete genomes under three biological approximations. Each stating an explicit neutral model and its respective deviations. 

These approximations are 

 1. Informational: where nucleotides are considered the fundamental units of the genomes. We measured the content of information of the genomes, along a broad array of species 
 2. Ecological: study the diversity of families of genetic elements (mostly transposable elements) in eukaryotes taking advantage of neutral models implemented by ecologists 
 3. Systemic: to detect the effect of natural selection on genes within defined functional categories or pathways.
