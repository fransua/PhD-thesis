    <bib-field|abstract|A classic textbook example of adaptive radiation
    under natural selection is the evolution of 14 closely related species of
    Darwin's finches (Fringillidae, Passeriformes), whose primary diversity
    lies in the size and shape of their beaks. Thus, ground finches have deep
    and wide beaks, cactus finches have long and pointed beaks (low depth and
    narrower width), and warbler finches have slender and pointed beaks,
    reflecting differences in their respective diets. Previous work has shown
    that even small differences in any of the three major dimensions (depth,
    width and length) of the beak have major consequences for the overall
    fitness of the birds. Recently we used a candidate gene approach to
    explain one pathway involved in Darwin's finch beak morphogenesis.
    However, this type of analysis is limited to molecules with a known
    association with craniofacial and/or skeletogenic development. Here we
    use a less constrained, complementary DNA microarray analysis of the
    transcripts expressed in the beak primordia to find previously unknown
    genes and pathways whose expression correlates with specific beak
    morphologies. We show that calmodulin (CaM), a molecule involved in
    mediating Ca2+ signalling, is expressed at higher levels in the long and
    pointed beaks of cactus finches than in more robust beak types of other
    species. We validated this observation with in situ hybridizations. When
    this upregulation of the CaM-dependent pathway is artificially replicated
    in the chick frontonasal prominence, it causes an elongation of the upper
    beak, recapitulating the beak morphology of the cactus finches. Our
    results indicate that local upregulation of the CaM-dependent pathway is
    likely to have been a component of the evolution of Darwin's finch
    species with elongated beak morphology and provide a mechanistic
    explanation for the independence of beak evolution along different axes.
    More generally, our results implicate the CaM-dependent pathway in the
    developmentregulation of craniofacial skeletal structures.>

    <bib-field|abstract|In addition to delivering a haploid genome to the
    egg, sperm have additional critical functions, including egg activation,
    origination of the zygote centrosome and delivery of paternal factors.
    Despite this, existing knowledge of the molecular basis of sperm form and
    function is limited. We used whole-sperm mass spectrometry to identify
    381 proteins of the Drosophila melanogaster sperm proteome (DmSP). This
    approach identified mitochondrial, metabolic and cytoskeletal proteins,
    in addition to several new functional categories. We also observed
    nonrandom genomic clustering of sperm genes and underrepresentation on
    the X chromosome. Identification of widespread functional constraint on
    the proteome indicates that sexual selection has had a limited role in
    the overall evolution of D. melanogaster sperm. The relevance of the DmSP
    to the study of mammalian sperm function and fertilization mechanisms is
    demonstrated by the identification of substantial homology between the
    DmSP and proteins of the mouse axoneme accessory structure.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Postcopulatory sperm competition is a key aspect of
    sexual selection and is believed to drive the rapid evolution of both
    reproductive physiology and reproduction-related genes. It is
    well-established that mating behavior determines the intensity of sperm
    competition, with polyandry (i.e., female promiscuity) leading to fiercer
    sperm competition than monandry. Studies in mammals, particularly
    primates, showed that, owing to greater sperm competition, polyandrous
    taxa generally have physiological traits that make them better adapted
    for fertilization than monandrous species, including bigger testes,
    larger seminal vesicles, higher sperm counts, richer mitochondrial
    loading in sperm and more prominent semen coagulation. Here, we show that
    the degree of polyandry can also impact the dynamics of molecular
    evolution. Specifically, we show that the evolution of SEMG2, the gene
    encoding semenogelin II, a main structural component of semen coagulum,
    is accelerated in polyandrous primates relative to monandrous primates.
    Our study showcases the intimate relationship between sexual selection
    and the molecular evolution of reproductive genes.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Cancers arise owing to mutations in a subset of genes
    that confer growth advantage. The availability of the human genome
    sequence led us to propose that systematic resequencing of cancer genomes
    for mutations would lead to the discovery of many additional cancer
    genes. Here we report more than 1,000 somatic mutations found in 274
    megabases (Mb) of DNA corresponding to the coding exons of 518 protein
    kinase genes in 210 diverse human cancers. There was substantial
    variation in the number and pattern of mutations in individual cancers
    reflecting different exposures, DNA repair defects and cellular origins.
    Most somatic mutations are likely to be 'passengers' that do not
    contribute to oncogenesis. However, there was evidence for 'driver'
    mutations contributing to the development of the cancers studied in
    approximately 120 genes. Systematic sequencing of cancer genomes
    therefore reveals the evolutionary diversity of cancers and implicates a
    larger repertoire of cancer genes than previously anticipated.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The role of natural selection in biology is well
    appreciated. Recently, however, a critical role for physical principles
    of network self-organization in biological systems has been revealed.
    Here, we employ a systems level view of genome-scale sequence and
    expression data to examine the interplay between these two sources of
    order, natural selection and physical self-organization, in the evolution
    of human gene regulation. The topology of a human gene coexpression
    network, derived from tissue-specific expression profiles, shows
    scale-free properties that imply evolutionary self-organization via
    preferential node attachment. Genes with numerous coexpressed partners
    (the hubs of the coexpression network) evolve more slowly on average than
    genes with fewer coexpressed partners, and genes that are coexpressed
    show similar rates of evolution. Thus, the strength of selective
    constraints on gene sequences is affected by the topology of the gene
    coexpression network. This connection is strong for the coding regions
    and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), but the 5' UTRs appear to evolve
    under a different regime. Surprisingly, we found no connection between
    the rate of gene sequence divergence and the extent of gene expression
    profile divergence between human and mouse. This suggests that distinct
    modes of natural selection might govern sequence versus expression
    divergence, and we propose a model, based on rapid, adaptation-driven
    divergence and convergent evolution of gene expression patterns, for how
    natural selection could influence gene expression divergence.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Conserved noncoding elements (CNCs) are an abundant
    feature of vertebrate genomes. Some CNCs have been shown to act as
    cis-regulatory modules, but the function of most CNCs remains unclear. To
    study the evolution of CNCs, we have developed a statistical method
    called the "shared rates test" to identify CNCs that show significant
    variation in substitution rates across branches of a phylogenetic tree.
    We report an application of this method to alignments of 98,910 CNCs from
    the human, chimpanzee, dog, mouse, and rat genomes. We find that
    approximately 68\\% of CNCs evolve according to a null model where, for
    each CNC, a single parameter models the level of constraint acting
    throughout the phylogeny linking these five species. The remaining
    approximately 32\\% of CNCs show departures from the basic model
    including speed-ups and slow-downs on particular branches and
    occasionally multiple rate changes on different branches. We find that a
    subset of the significant CNCs have evolved significantly faster than the
    local neutral rate on a particular branch, providing strong evidence for
    adaptive evolution in these CNCs. The distribution of these signals on
    the phylogeny suggests that adaptive evolution of CNCs occurs in
    occasional short bursts of evolution. Our analyses suggest a large set of
    promising targets for future functional studies of adaptation.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Regional rates of recombination often correlate with
    levels of nucleotide diversity, and either selective or neutral
    hypotheses can explain this relationship. Regional recombination rates
    also correlate with nucleotide differences between human and chimpanzee,
    consistent with models where recombination is mutagenic; however, a lack
    of correlation is observed in the Drosophila melanogaster group,
    consistent with models invoking natural selection. Here, we revisit the
    relationship among recombination, diversity, and interspecies difference
    by generating empirical estimates of these parameters in Drosophila
    pseudoobscura. To measure recombination rate, we genotyped 1,294
    backcross hybrids at 50 markers across the largest assembled linkage
    group in this species. Genome-wide diversity was estimated by sequencing
    a second isolate of D. pseudoobscura at shallow coverage. Alignment to
    the sequenced genome of the closely related species, Drosophila
    persimilis, provided nucleotide site orthology. Our findings demonstrate
    that scale is critical in determining correlates to recombination rate:
    fine-scale cross-over rate estimates are far stronger predictors of both
    diversity and interspecies difference than broad-scale estimates. The
    correlation of fine-scale recombination rate to diversity and
    interspecies difference appears to be genome-wide, evidenced by
    examination of an X-linked region in greater detail. Because we observe a
    strong correlation of cross-over rate with interspecies difference, even
    after correcting for segregating ancestral variation, we suggest that
    both mutagenic and selective forces generate these correlations, the
    latter in regions of low crossing over. We propose that it is not
    cross-overs per se that are mutagenic, but rather repair of DNA
    double-strand break precursors via crossing over and gene conversion.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Small noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) can contribute to
    cancer development and progression and are differentially expressed in
    normal tissues and cancers. From a large-scale miRnome analysis on 540
    samples including lung, breast, stomach, prostate, colon, and pancreatic
    tumors, we identified a solid cancer miRNA signature composed by a large
    portion of overexpressed miRNAs. Among these miRNAs are some with well
    characterized cancer association, such as miR-17-5p, miR-20a, miR-21,
    miR-92, miR-106a, and miR-155. The predicted targets for the
    differentially expressed miRNAs are significantly enriched for
    protein-coding tumor suppressors and oncogenes (P \< 0.0001). A number of
    the predicted targets, including the tumor suppressors RB1
    (Retinoblastoma 1) and TGFBR2 (transforming growth factor, beta receptor
    II) genes were confirmed experimentally. Our results indicate that miRNAs
    are extensively involved in cancer pathogenesis of solid tumors and
    support their function as either dominant or recessive cancer genes.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Comparative sequence analysis is contributing to the
    identification and characterization of genomic regulatory regions with
    functional roles. It is effective because functionally important regions
    tend to evolve at a slower rate than do less important regions. The
    choice of species for comparative analysis is crucial: shared ancestry of
    a clade of species facilitates the discovery of genomic features
    important to that clade, whereas increased sequence divergence improves
    the resolution at which features can be discovered. Recent studies
    suggest that comparative analyses are useful for all branches of life and
    that, in the near future, large-scale mammalian comparative sequence
    analysis will provide the best approach for the comprehensive discovery
    of human regulatory elements.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The organization of chromosomes is important for
    various biological processes and is involved in the formation of
    rearrangements often observed in cancer. In mammals, chromosomes are
    organized in territories that are radially positioned in the nucleus.
    However, it remains unclear whether chromosomes are organized relative to
    each other. Here, we examine the nuclear arrangement of 10 chromosomes in
    human epithelial cancer cells by three-dimensional FISH analysis. We show
    that their radial position correlates with the ratio of their gene
    density to chromosome size. We also observe that inter-homologue
    distances are generally larger than inter-heterologue distances. Using
    numerical simulations taking radial position constraints into account, we
    demonstrate that, for some chromosomes, radial position is enough to
    justify the inter-homologue distance, whereas for others additional
    constraints are involved. Among these constraints, we propose that
    nucleolar organizer regions participate in the internal positioning of
    the acrocentric chromosome HSA21, possibly through interactions with
    nucleoli. Maintaining distance between homologous chromosomes in human
    cells could participate in regulating genome stability and gene
    expression, both mechanisms that are key players in tumorigenesis.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Previous studies have suggested that the frequency of
    chromosomal aberrations (CAs), but not of sister chromatid exchanges
    (SCEs), predicts cancer risk. We have further examined this relationship
    in European cohorts comprising altogether almost 22,000 subjects, in the
    framework of a European collaborative project (CancerRiskBiomarkers). The
    present paper gives an overview of some of the results of the project,
    especially as regards CAs and SCEs. The results confirm that a high level
    of CAs is associated with an increased risk of cancer and indicate that
    this association does not depend on the time between CA analysis and
    cancer detection, i.e., is obviously not explained by undetected cancer.
    The present evidence indicates that both chromatid-type and
    chromosome-type CAs predict cancer, even though some data suggest that
    chromosome-type CAs may have a more pronounced predictive value than
    chromatid-type CAs. CA frequency appears to predict cancers at various
    sites, although there seems to be a particular association with
    gastrointestinal cancers. SCE frequency does not appear to have cancer
    predictive value, at least partly due to uncontrollable technical
    variation. A number of genetic polymorphisms of xenobiotic metabolism,
    DNA repair, and folate metabolism affect the level of CAs and might
    collectively contribute to the cancer predictivity of CAs. Other factors
    that may influence the association between CAs and cancer include, e.g.,
    exposure to genotoxic carcinogens and internal generation of genotoxic
    species. Although the association between CA level and cancer is seen at
    the group level, an association probably also exists for the individual,
    although it is not known if an individual approach could be feasible.
    However, group level evidence should be enough to support the use of CA
    analysis as a tool in screening programs and prevention policies in
    occupational and environmental health.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Explaining how interactions between genes and the
    environment influence social behavior is a fundamental research goal, yet
    there is limited relevant information for species exhibiting natural
    variation in social organization. The fire ant Solenopsis invicta is
    characterized by a remarkable form of social polymorphism, with the
    presence of one or several queens per colony and the expression of other
    phenotypic and behavioral differences being completely associated with
    allelic variation at a single Mendelian factor marked by the gene Gp-9.
    Microarray analyses of adult workers revealed that differences in the
    Gp-9 genotype are associated with the differential expression of an
    unexpectedly small number of genes, many of which have predicted
    functions, implying a role in chemical communication relevant to the
    regulation of colony queen number. Even more surprisingly, worker gene
    expression profiles are more strongly influenced by indirect effects
    associated with the Gp-9 genotypic composition within their colony than
    by the direct effect of their own Gp-9 genotype. This constitutes an
    unusual example of an "extended phenotype" and suggests a complex genetic
    architecture with a single Mendelian factor, directly and indirectly
    influencing the individual behaviors that, in aggregate, produce an
    emergent colony-level phenotype.>

    <bib-field|abstract|This study utilized mRNA differential display and the
    Gene Ontology (GO) analysis to characterize the multiple interactions of
    a number of genes involved in human papillomavirus (HPV)-16-induced
    cervical carcinogenesis. We used HPV-16-positive cervical cancer cell
    line (SiHa) and normal human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) as a control.
    Each gene has several biological functions in the GO, and hence, we
    chosen the several functions for each gene. and then, the specific
    functions were correlated with gene expression patterns. The results
    showed that 157 genes were up- or down-regulated above two-fold and
    organized into mutually dependent subfunction sets depending on the
    cervical cancer pathway, suggesting the potentially significant genes of
    unknown function. The GO analysis suggested that cervical cancer cells
    underwent repression of cancer-specific cell-adhesive properties. Also,
    genes belonging to DNA metabolism such as DNA repair and replication were
    strongly down-regulated, whereas significant increases were shown in
    protein degradation and in protein synthesis. The GO analysis can
    overcome the complexity of the gene expression profile of the
    HPV-16-associated pathway and identify several cancer-specific cellular
    processes as well as genes of unknown function. Also, it can become a
    major competing platform for the genome-wide characterization of
    carcinogenesis.>

    <bib-field|abstract|We address the problem of comparing and
    characterizing the promoter regions of genes with similar expression
    patterns. This remains a challenging problem in sequence analysis,
    because often the promoter regions of co-expressed genes do not show
    discernible sequence conservation. In our approach, thus, we have not
    directly compared the nucleotide sequence of promoters. Instead, we have
    obtained predictions of transcription factor binding sites, annotated the
    predicted sites with the labels of the corresponding binding factors, and
    aligned the resulting sequences of labels--to which we refer here as
    transcription factor maps (TF-maps). To obtain the global pairwise
    alignment of two TF-maps, we have adapted an algorithm initially
    developed to align restriction enzyme maps. We have optimized the
    parameters of the algorithm in a small, but well-curated, collection of
    human-mouse orthologous gene pairs. Results in this dataset, as well as
    in an independent much larger dataset from the CISRED database, indicate
    that TF-map alignments are able to uncover conserved regulatory elements,
    which cannot be detected by the typical sequence alignments.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Agouti-related protein encodes a neuropeptide that
    stimulates food intake. Agrp expression in the brain is restricted to
    neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and is elevated by
    states of negative energy balance. The molecular mechanisms underlying
    Agrp regulation, however, remain poorly defined. Using a combination of
    transgenic and comparative sequence analysis, we have previously
    identified a 760 bp conserved region upstream of Agrp which contains STAT
    binding elements that participate in Agrp transcriptional regulation. In
    this study, we attempt to improve the specificity for detecting conserved
    elements in this region by comparing genomic sequences from 10 mammalian
    species. Our analysis reveals a symmetrical organization of conserved
    sequences upstream of Agrp, which cluster into two inverted repeat
    elements. Conserved sequences within these elements suggest a role for
    homeodomain proteins in the regulation of Agrp and provide additional

    <bib-field|abstract|The sex chromosomes and autosomes spend different
    times in the germ line of the two sexes. If cell division is mutagenic
    and if the sexes differ in number of cell divisions, then we expect that
    sequences on the X and Y chromosomes and autosomes should mutate at
    different rates. Tests of this hypothesis for several mammalian species
    have led to conflicting results. At the same time, recent evidence
    suggests that the chromosomal location of genes on autosomes affects
    their rate of evolution at synonymous sites. This suggests a mutagenic
    source different from germ cell replication. To correctly interpret the
    previous estimates of male mutation bias, it is crucial to understand the
    degree and range of this local similarity. With a carefully chosen
    randomization protocol, local similarity in synonymous rates of evolution
    can be detected in human-rodent and mouse-rat comparisons. However, the
    synonymous-site similarity in the mouse-rat comparison remains weak.
    Simulations suggest that this difference between the mouse-human and the
    mouse-rat comparisons is not artifactual and that there is therefore a
    difference between humans and rodents in the local patterns of mutation
    or selection on synonymous sites (conversely, we show that the previously
    reported absence of a local similarity in nonsynonymous rates of
    evolution in the human-rodent comparison was a methodological artifact).
    We show that linkage effects have a long-range component: not one in a
    million random genomes shows such levels of autosomal heterogeneity. The
    heterogeneity is so great that more autosomes than expected by chance
    have rates of synonymous evolution comparable with that of the X
    chromosome. As autosomal heterogeneity cannot be owing to different times
    spent in the germ line, this demonstrates that the dominant determiner of
    synonymous rates of evolution is not, as has been conjectured, the time

    <bib-field|abstract|Despite the growing interest in the molecular
    epidemiology of pestivirus, there have been few attempts to determine
    which regions of the pestivirus genome are subject to positive selection,
    although this may be a key indicator of the nature of the interaction
    between host and virus. By using likelihood-based methods for
    phylogenetic inference, the positive selection pressure of BVDV-1 E2 gene
    were assessed and a site-by-site analysis of the dN/dS ratio was
    performed, to identify specific codons undergoing diversifying positive
    selection. The overall omega was 0.20, indicating that most sites were
    subject to strong purifying selection and five positively selected sites
    (886, 888, 905, 944, and 946) were identified. It is surprising to find
    that all the potential positively selected sites fall within the
    C-terminal of E2, and out of the N-terminal of E2 which is thought to be
    surface-exposed and therefore prime targets for host antibody response.
    In conclusion, these results suggest that selection favoring avoidance of
    antibody recognition has not been a major factor in the history of
    BVDV-1. Further analysis is necessary to see if amino acid substitutions
    in the BVDV-1 positively selected sites can lead to change of host
    tropism or$\\backslash$and escape from epitope-specific CD8 T-cell
    response.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Approximate methods for estimating the numbers of
    synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions between two DNA sequences
    involve three steps: counting of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites in
    the two sequences, counting of synonymous and nonsynonymous differences
    between the two sequences, and correcting for multiple substitutions at
    the same site. We examine complexities involved in those steps and
    propose a new approximate method that takes into account two major
    features of DNA sequence evolution: transition/transversion rate bias and
    base/codon frequency bias. We compare the new method with maximum
    likelihood, as well as several other approximate methods, by examining
    infinitely long sequences, performing computer simulations, and analyzing
    a real data set. The results suggest that when there are
    transition/transversion rate biases and base/codon frequency biases,
    previously described approximate methods for estimating the
    nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio may involve serious biases, and the
    bias can be both positive and negative. The new method is, in general,
    superior to earlier approximate methods and may be useful for analyzing
    large data sets, although maximum likelihood appears to always be the
    method of choice.>

    <bib-field|abstract|A maximum likelihood approach was used to estimate
    the synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates in 48 nuclear genes
    from primates, artiodactyls, and rodents. A codon-substitution model was
    assumed, which accounts for the genetic code structure,
    transition/transversion bias, and base frequency biases at codon
    positions. Likelihood ratio tests were applied to test the constancy of
    nonsynonymous to synonymous rate ratios among branches (evolutionary
    lineages). It is found that at 22 of the 48 nuclear loci examined, the
    nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio varies significantly across branches
    of the tree. The result provides strong evidence against a strictly
    neutral model of molecular evolution. Our likelihood estimates of
    synonymous and nonsynonymous rates differ considerably from previous
    results obtained from approximate pairwise sequence comparisons. The
    differences between the methods are explored by detailed analyses of data
    from several genes. Transition/transversion rate bias and codon frequency
    biases are found to have significant effects on the estimation of
    synonymous and nonsynonymous rates, and approximate methods do not
    adequately account for those factors. The likelihood approach is
    preferable, even for pairwise sequence comparison, because more realistic
    models about the mutation and substitution processes can be incorporated
    in the analysis.>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: Identifying factors affecting gene
    expression variation is a challenging problem in genetics. Previous
    studies have shown that the presence of TATA box, the number of
    cis-regulatory elements, gene essentiality, and protein interactions
    significantly affect gene expression variation. Nonetheless, the need to
    obtain a more complete understanding of such factors and how their
    interactions influence gene expression variation remains a challenge. The
    growth rates of yeast cells under several DNA-damaging conditions have
    been studied and a gene's toxicity degree is defined as the number of
    such conditions that the growth rate of the yeast deletion strain is
    significantly affected. Since toxicity degree reflects a gene's
    importance to cell survival under DNA-damaging conditions, we expect that
    it is negatively associated with gene expression variation. Mutations in
    both cis-regulatory elements and transcription factors (TF) regulating a
    gene affect the gene's expression and thus we study the relationship
    between gene expression variation and the number of TFs regulating a
    gene. Most importantly we study how these factors interact with each
    other influencing gene expression variation. RESULTS: Using yeast as a
    model system, we evaluated the effects of four separate factors and their
    interactions on gene expression variation: protein interaction degree,
    toxicity degree, number of TFs, and the presence of TATA box. Results
    showed that 1) gene expression variation is negatively correlated with
    the protein interaction degree in the protein interaction network, 2)
    essential genes tend to have less expression variation than non-essential
    genes and gene expression variation decreases with toxicity degree, and
    3) the number of TFs regulating a gene is the most important factor
    influencing gene expression variation (R2 = 8-14\\%). In addition, the
    number of TFs regulating a gene was found to be an important factor
    influencing gene expression variation for both TATA-containing and
    non-TATA-containing genes, but with different association strength.
    Moreover, gene expression variation was significantly negatively
    correlated with toxicity degree only for TATA-containing genes.
    CONCLUSION: The finding that distinct mechanisms may influence gene
    expression variation in TATA-containing and non-TATA-containing genes,
    provides new insights into the mechanisms that underlie the evolution of
    gene expression.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Whole-genome duplication followed by massive gene
    loss and specialization has long been postulated as a powerful mechanism
    of evolutionary innovation. Recently, it has become possible to test this
    notion by searching complete genome sequence for signs of ancient
    duplication. Here, we show that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae arose
    from ancient whole-genome duplication, by sequencing and analysing
    Kluyveromyces waltii, a related yeast species that diverged before the
    duplication. The two genomes are related by a 1:2 mapping, with each
    region of K. waltii corresponding to two regions of S. cerevisiae, as
    expected for whole-genome duplication. This resolves the long-standing
    controversy on the ancestry of the yeast genome, and makes it possible to
    study the fate of duplicated genes directly. Strikingly, 95\\% of cases
    of accelerated evolution involve only one member of a gene pair,
    providing strong support for a specific model of evolution, and allowing
    us to distinguish ancestral and derived functions.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Because of recent advances in genotyping and
    sequencing, human genetic variation and adaptive evolution in the primate
    lineage have become major research foci. Here, we examine the
    relationship between genetic signatures of adaptive evolution and network
    topology. We find a striking tendency of proteins that have been under
    positive selection (as compared with the chimpanzee) to be located at the
    periphery of the interaction network. Our results are based on the
    analysis of two types of genome evolution, both in terms of intra- and
    interspecies variation. First, we looked at single-nucleotide
    polymorphisms and their fixed variants, single-nucleotide differences in
    the human genome relative to the chimpanzee. Second, we examine fixed
    structural variants, specifically large segmental duplications and their
    polymorphic precursors known as copy number variants. We propose two
    complementary mechanisms that lead to the observed trends. First, we can
    rationalize them in terms of constraints imposed by protein structure: We
    find that positively selected sites are preferentially located on the
    exposed surface of proteins. Because central network proteins (hubs) are
    likely to have a larger fraction of their surface involved in
    interactions, they tend to be constrained and under negative selection.
    Conversely, we show that the interaction network roughly maps to cellular
    organization, with the periphery of the network corresponding to the
    cellular periphery (i.e., extracellular space or cell membrane). This
    suggests that the observed positive selection at the network periphery
    may be due to an increase of adaptive events on the cellular periphery
    responding to changing environments.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Genomic sequencing has made it clear that a large
    fraction of the genes specifying the core biological functions are shared
    by all eukaryotes. Knowledge of the biological role of such shared
    proteins in one organism can often be transferred to other organisms. The
    goal of the Gene Ontology Consortium is to produce a dynamic, controlled
    vocabulary that can be applied to all eukaryotes even as knowledge of
    gene and protein roles in cells is accumulating and changing. To this
    end, three independent ontologies accessible on the World-Wide Web
    (http://www.geneontology.org) are being constructed: biological process,
    molecular function and cellular component.>

    <bib-field|abstract|To fully understand genome function, the linear
    genome map must be integrated with a spatial map of chromosomes in the
    nucleus. Distinct nuclear addresses for a few human chromosomes have been
    described. Previously we have demonstrated that the gene-rich human
    chromosome 19 is located in a more central position in the nucleus than
    the similarly sized, but gene-poor, chromosome 18. To determine whether
    these two chromosomes are a paradigm for the organization of chromatin in
    the human nucleus, we have now analysed the nuclear organization of every
    human chromosome in diploid lymphoblasts and primary fibroblasts. We find
    that the most gene-rich chromosomes concentrate at the centre of the
    nucleus, whereas the more gene-poor chromosomes are located towards the
    nuclear periphery. In contrast, we find no significant relationship
    between chromosome size and position within the nucleus. Proteins of the
    nuclear membrane or lamina are candidates for molecules that might anchor
    regions of the genome at the nuclear periphery and it has been suggested
    that disruption of this organization may play a role in some disease
    pathologies. We show that the intranuclear organization of chromosomes is
    not altered in cells that lack the integral nuclear membrane protein
    emerin, from an individual with X-linked Emery--Dreifuss muscular
    dystrophy. This suggests that emerin is not necessary for localizing
    chromosomes at the nuclear periphery and that the muscular dystrophy
    phenotype in such individuals is not due to grossly altered nuclear
    organization of chromatin.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Transcriptional coexpression of interacting gene
    products is required for complex molecular processes; however, the
    function and evolution of cis-regulatory elements that orchestrate
    coexpression remain largely unexplored. We mutagenized 19 regulatory
    elements that drive coexpression of Ciona muscle genes and obtained
    quantitative estimates of the cis-regulatory activity of the 77 motifs
    that comprise these elements. We found that individual motif activity
    ranges broadly within and among elements, and among different
    instantiations of the same motif type. The activity of orthologous motifs
    is strongly constrained, although motif arrangement, type, and activity
    vary greatly among the elements of different co-regulated genes. Thus,
    the syntactical rules governing this regulatory function are flexible but
    become highly constrained evolutionarily once they are established in a
    particular element.>

    <bib-field|abstract|We compare the functional spectrum of protein
    evolution in two separate animal lineages with respect to two hypotheses:
    (1) rates of divergence are distributed similarly among functional
    classes within both lineages, indicating that selective pressure on the
    proteome is largely independent of organismic-level biological
    requirements; and (2) rates of divergence are distributed differently
    among functional classes within each lineage, indicating species-specific
    selective regimes impact genome-wide substitutional patterns. Integrating
    comparative genome sequence with data from tissue-specific
    expressed-sequence-tag (EST) libraries and detailed database annotations,
    we find a functional genomic signature of rapid evolution and selective
    constraint shared between mammalian and nematode lineages despite their
    extensive morphological and ecological differences and distant common
    ancestry. In both phyla, we find evidence of accelerated evolution among
    components of molecular systems involved in coevolutionary change. In
    mammals, lineage-specific fast evolving genes include those involved in
    reproduction, immunity, and possibly, maternal-fetal conflict. Likelihood
    ratio tests provide evidence for positive selection in these rapidly
    evolving functional categories in mammals. In contrast, slowly evolving
    genes, in terms of amino acid or insertion/deletion (indel) change, in
    both phyla are involved in core molecular processes such as
    transcription, translation, and protein transport. Thus, strong purifying
    selection appears to act on the same core cellular processes in both
    mammalian and nematode lineages, whereas positive and/or relaxed
    selection acts on different biological processes in each lineage.>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: Alignment and comparison of related
    genome sequences is a powerful method to identify regions likely to
    contain functional elements. Such analyses are data intensive, requiring
    the inclusion of genomic multiple sequence alignments, sequence
    annotations, and scores describing regional attributes of columns in the
    alignment. Visualization and browsing of results can be difficult, and
    there are currently limited software options for performing this task.
    RESULTS: The Application for Browsing Constraints (ABC) is interactive
    Java software for intuitive and efficient exploration of multiple
    sequence alignments and data typically associated with alignments. It is
    used to move quickly from a summary view of the entire alignment via
    arbitrary levels of resolution to individual alignment columns. It allows
    for the simultaneous display of quantitative data, (e.g., sequence
    similarity or evolutionary rates) and annotation data (e.g. the locations
    of genes, repeats, and constrained elements). It can be used to
    facilitate basic comparative sequence tasks, such as export of data in
    plain-text formats, visualization of phylogenetic trees, and generation
    of alignment summary graphics. CONCLUSIONS: The ABC is a lightweight,
    stand-alone, and flexible graphical user interface for browsing genomic
    multiple sequence alignments of specific loci, up to hundreds of
    kilobases or a few megabases in length. It is coded in Java for
    cross-platform use and the program and source code are freely available
    under the General Public License. Documentation and a sample data set are
    also available http://mendel.stanford.edu/sidowlab/downloads.html.>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the
    most common causes of cancer-related deaths in the Western world, and
    despite the fact that metastases are usually the ultimate cause of
    deaths, the knowledge of the genetics of advanced stages of this disease
    is limited. In order to identify potential genetic abnormalities
    underlying the development of local and distant metastases in CRC
    patients, we have, by comparative genomic hybridization, compared the DNA
    copy number profiles of 10 primary carcinomas, 14 local recurrences, 7
    peritoneal carcinomatoses, and 42 liver metastases from 61 CRC patients.
    RESULTS: The median number of aberrations among the primary carcinomas,
    local recurrences, carcinomatoses, and liver metastases was 10, 6, 13,
    and 14, respectively. Several genetic imbalances, such as gains of 7, 8q,
    13q, and 20, and losses of 4q, 8p, 17p, and 18, were common in all
    groups. In contrast, gains of 5p and 12p were more common in the
    carcinomatoses than in other stages of the disease. With hierarchical
    cluster analysis, liver metastases could be divided into two main
    subgroups according to clusters of chromosome changes. CONCLUSIONS: Each
    stage of CRC progression is characterized by a particular genetic
    profile, and both carcinomatoses and liver metastases are more
    genetically complex than local recurrences and primary carcinomas. This
    is the first genome profiling of local recurrences and carcinomatoses,
    and gains of 5p and 12p seem to be particularly important for the spread
    of the CRC cells within the peritoneal cavity.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The remarkable olfactory power of insect species is
    thought to be generated by a combinatorial action of two large protein
    families, G protein-coupled olfactory receptors (ORs) and odorant binding
    proteins (OBPs). In olfactory sensilla, OBPs deliver hydrophobic airborne
    molecules to ORs, but their expression in nonolfactory tissues suggests
    that they also may function as general carriers in other developmental
    and physiological processes. Here we used bioinformatic and experimental
    approaches to characterize the OBP-like gene family in a highly social
    insect, the Western honey bee. Comparison with other insects shows that
    the honey bee has the smallest set of these genes, consisting of only 21
    OBPs. This number stands in stark contrast to the more than 70 OBPs in
    Anopheles gambiae and 51 in Drosophila melanogaster. In the honey bee as
    in the two dipterans, these genes are organized in clusters. We show that
    the evolution of their structure involved frequent intron losses. We
    describe a monophyletic subfamily of OBPs where the diversification of
    some amino acids appears to have been accelerated by positive selection.
    Expression profiling under a wide range of conditions shows that in the
    honey bee only nine OBPs are antenna-specific. The remaining genes are
    expressed either ubiquitously or are tightly regulated in specialized
    tissues or during development. These findings support the view that OBPs
    are not restricted to olfaction and are likely to be involved in broader
    physiological functions.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The molecular changes responsible for the evolution
    of modern humans have primarily been discussed in terms of individual
    nucleotide substitutions in regulatory or protein coding sequences.
    However, rates of nucleotide substitution are slowed in primates, and
    thus humans and chimpanzees are highly similar at the nucleotide level.
    We find that a third source of molecular evolution, gene gain and loss,
    is accelerated in primates relative to other mammals. Using a novel
    method that allows estimation of rate heterogeneity among lineages, we
    find that the rate of gene turnover in humans is more than 2.5 times
    faster than in other mammals and may be due to both mutational and
    selective forces. By reconciling the gene trees for all of the gene
    families included in the analysis, we are able to independently verify
    the numbers of inferred duplications. We also use two methods based on
    the genome assembly of rhesus macaque to further verify our results. Our
    analyses identify several gene families that have expanded or contracted
    more rapidly than is expected even after accounting for an overall rate
    acceleration in primates, including brain-related families that have more
    than doubled in size in humans. Many of the families showing large
    expansions also show evidence for positive selection on their nucleotide
    sequences, suggesting that selection has been important in shaping
    copy-number differences among mammals. These findings may help explain
    why humans and chimpanzees show high similarity between orthologous
    nucleotides yet great morphological and behavioral differences.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Studies of interacting proteins have found correlated
    evolution of the sequences of binding partners, apparently as a result of
    compensating mutations to maintain specificity (i.e., molecular
    coevolution). Here, we analyze the coevolution of interacting proteins in
    yeast and demonstrate correlated evolution of binding partners in
    eukaryotes. Detailed investigation of this apparent coevolution, focusing
    on the proteins' surface and binding interface, surprisingly leads to no
    improvement in the correlation. We conclude that true coevolution, as
    characterized by compensatory mutations between binding partners, is
    unlikely to be chiefly responsible for the apparent correlated evolution.
    We postulate that the correlation between sequence alignments is simply
    due to interacting proteins being subject to similar constraints on their
    evolutionary rate. Because gene expression has a strong influence on
    evolutionary rate, and interacting proteins will tend to have similar
    levels of expression, we investigated this particular constraint. We
    found that the absolute expression level outperformed correlated
    evolution for predicting interacting protein partners. A correlation
    between sequence alignments could also be identified not only between
    pairs of proteins that physically interact but also between those that
    are merely functionally related (i.e., within the same protein complex).
    This indicates that the observed correlated evolution of interacting
    proteins is due to similar constraints on evolutionary rate and not
    coevolution.>

    <bib-field|abstract|It is generally accepted that the extent of
    phenotypic change between human and great apes is dissonant with the rate
    of molecular change. Between these two groups, proteins are virtually
    identical, cytogenetically there are few rearrangements that distinguish
    ape-human chromosomes, and rates of single-base-pair change and
    retrotransposon activity have slowed particularly within hominid lineages
    when compared to rodents or monkeys. Studies of gene family evolution
    indicate that gene loss and gain are enriched within the primate lineage.
    Here, we perform a systematic analysis of duplication content of four
    primate genomes (macaque, orang-utan, chimpanzee and human) in an effort
    to understand the pattern and rates of genomic duplication during hominid
    evolution. We find that the ancestral branch leading to human and African
    great apes shows the most significant increase in duplication activity
    both in terms of base pairs and in terms of events. This duplication
    acceleration within the ancestral species is significant when compared to
    lineage-specific rate estimates even after accounting for copy-number
    polymorphism and homoplasy. We discover striking examples of recurrent
    and independent gene-containing duplications within the gorilla and
    chimpanzee that are absent in the human lineage. Our results suggest that
    the evolutionary properties of copy-number mutation differ significantly
    from other forms of genetic mutation and, in contrast to the hominid
    slowdown of single-base-pair mutations, there has been a genomic burst of
    duplication activity at this period during human evolution.>

    <bib-field|abstract|An excess of nonsynonymous over synonymous
    substitution at individual amino acid sites is an important indicator
    that positive selection has affected the evolution of a protein between
    the extant sequences under study and their most recent common ancestor.
    Several methods exist to detect the presence, and sometimes location, of
    positively selected sites in alignments of protein-coding sequences. This
    article describes the "sitewise likelihood-ratio" (SLR) method for
    detecting nonneutral evolution, a statistical test that can identify
    sites that are unusually conserved as well as those that are unusually
    variable. We show that the SLR method can be more powerful than currently
    published methods for detecting the location of positive selection,
    especially in difficult cases where the strength of selection is low. The
    increase in power is achieved while relaxing assumptions about how the
    strength of selection varies over sites and without elevated rates of
    false-positive results that have been reported with some other methods.
    We also show that the SLR method performs well even under circumstances
    where the results from some previous methods can be misleading.>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: Heat-shock proteins are specialized
    molecules performing different and essential roles in the cell including
    protein degradation, folding and trafficking. GroEL is a 60 Kda
    heat-shock protein ubiquitous in bacteria and has been regarded as an
    important molecule implicated in chronic inflammatory processes caused by
    Chlamydiae infections. GroEL in Chlamydiae became duplicated at the
    origin of the Chlamydiae lineage presenting three distinct molecular
    chaperones, namely the original protein GroEL1 (Ct110), and its
    paralogous proteins GroEL2 (Ct604) and GroEL3 (Ct755). These chaperones
    present differential and independent expressions during the different
    stages of Chlamydiae infections and have been suggested to present
    differential physiological and regulatory roles. RESULTS: In this
    comprehensive in silico study we show that GroEL protein paralogs have
    diverged functionally after the different gene duplication events and
    that this divergence has occurred mainly between GroEL3 and GroEL1.
    GroEL2 presents an intermediate functional divergence pattern from
    GroEL1. Our results point to the different protein-protein interaction
    patterns between GroEL paralogs and known GroEL protein clients
    supporting their functional divergence after groEL gene duplication.
    Analysis of selective constraints identifies periods of adaptive
    evolution after gene duplication that led to the fixation of amino acid
    replacements in GroEL protein domains involved in the interaction with
    GroEL protein clients. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that GroEL protein
    copies in Chlamydiae species have diverged functionally after the gene
    duplication events. We also show that functional divergence has occurred
    in important functional regions of these GroEL proteins and that very
    probably have affected the ancestral GroEL regulatory role and
    protein-protein interaction patterns with GroEL client proteins. Most of
    the amino acid replacements that have affected interaction with protein
    clients and that were responsible for the functional divergence between
    GroEL paralogs were fixed by adaptive evolution after the groEL gene
    duplication events.>

    <bib-field|abstract|There is increasing evidence that genome-wide
    association (GWA) studies represent a powerful approach to the
    identification of genes involved in common human diseases. We describe a
    joint GWA study (using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set)
    undertaken in the British population, which has examined 2,000
    individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of 3,000
    controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association
    signals at P \< 5 10-7: 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery
    disease, 9 in Crohn's disease, 3 in rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1
    diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and
    replication studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals
    reflect genuine susceptibility effects. We observed association at many
    previously identified loci, and found compelling evidence that some loci
    confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all
    diseases, we identified a large number of further signals (including 58
    loci with single-point P values between 10-5 and 5 10-7) likely to yield
    additional susceptibility loci. The importance of appropriately large
    samples was confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci
    identified. This study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA
    approach. It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared control
    group represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of
    multiple disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype
    database for future studies of common diseases in the British population;
    and shown that, provided individuals with non-European ancestry are
    excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British
    population is generally modest. Our findings offer new avenues for
    exploring the pathophysiology of these important disorders. We anticipate
    that our data, results and software, which will be widely available to
    other investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human genetics
    research.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Mammalian sperm DNA is the most tightly compacted
    eukaryotic DNA, being at least sixfold more highly condensed than the DNA
    in mitotic chromosomes. To achieve this high degree of packaging, sperm
    DNA interacts with protamines to form linear, side-by-side arrays of
    chromatin. This differs markedly from the bulkier DNA packaging of
    somatic cell nuclei and mitotic chromosomes, in which the DNA is coiled
    around histone octamers to form nucleosomes. The overall organization of
    mammalian sperm DNA, however, resembles that of somatic cells in that
    both the linear arrays of sperm chromatin and the 30-nm solenoid
    filaments of somatic cell chromatin are organized into loop domains
    attached at their bases to a nuclear matrix. In addition to the sperm
    nuclear matrix, sperm nuclei contain a unique structure termed the sperm
    nuclear annulus to which the entire complement of DNA appears to be
    anchored when the nuclear matrix is disrupted during decondensation. In
    somatic cells, proper function of DNA is dependent upon the structural
    organization of the DNA by the nuclear matrix, and the structural
    organization of sperm DNA is likely to be just as vital to the proper
    functioning of the spermatozoa.>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a critical
    cytokine in the immune response whose transcriptional activation is
    controlled by a proximal promoter region that is highly conserved in
    mammals and, in particular, primates. Specific single nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs) upstream of the proximal human TNF promoter have
    been identified, which are markers of human ancestry.
    METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a comparative genomics approach we
    show that certain fixed genetic differences in the TNF promoter serve as
    markers of primate speciation. We also demonstrate that distinct alleles
    of most human TNF promoter SNPs are identical to fixed nucleotides in
    primate TNF promoters. Furthermore, we identify fixed genetic differences
    within the proximal TNF promoters of Asian apes that do not occur in
    African ape or human TNF promoters. Strikingly, protein-DNA binding
    assays and gene reporter assays comparing these Asian ape TNF promoters
    to African ape and human TNF promoters demonstrate that, unlike the fixed
    differences that we define that are associated with primate phylogeny,
    these Asian ape-specific fixed differences impair transcription factor
    binding at an Sp1 site and decrease TNF transcription induced by
    bacterial stimulation of macrophages. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Here, we
    have presented the broadest interspecies comparison of a regulatory
    region of an innate immune response gene to date. We have characterized
    nucleotide positions in Asian ape TNF promoters that underlie functional
    changes in cell type- and stimulus-specific activation of the TNF gene.
    We have also identified ancestral TNF promoter nucleotide states in the
    primate lineage that correspond to human SNP alleles. These findings may
    reflect evolution of Asian and African apes under a distinct set of
    infectious disease pressures involving the innate immune response and
    TNF.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The anatomical basis and adaptive function of the
    expansion in primate brain size have long been studied; however, we are
    only beginning to understand the genetic basis of these evolutionary
    changes. Genes linked to human primary microcephaly have received much
    attention as they have accelerated evolutionary rates along lineages
    leading to humans. However, these studies focus narrowly on apes, and the
    link between microcephaly gene evolution and brain evolution is disputed.
    We analyzed the molecular evolution of four genes associated with
    microcephaly (ASPM, CDK5RAP2, CENPJ, MCPH1) across 21 species
    representing all major clades of anthropoid primates. Contrary to
    prevailing assumptions, positive selection was not limited to or
    intensified along the lineage leading to humans. In fact we show that all
    four loci were subject to positive selection across the anthropoid
    primate phylogeny. We developed clearly defined hypotheses to explicitly
    test if selection on these loci was associated with the evolution of
    brain size. We found positive relationships between both CDK5RAP2 and
    ASPM and neonatal brain mass and somewhat weaker relationships between
    these genes and adult brain size. In contrast, there is no evidence
    linking CENPJ and MCPH1 to brain size evolution. The stronger association
    of ASPM and CDK5RAP2 evolution with neonatal brain size than with adult
    brain size is consistent with these loci having a direct effect on
    prenatal neuronal proliferation. These results suggest that primate brain
    size may have at least a partially conserved genetic basis. Our results
    contradict a previous study that linked adaptive evolution of ASPM to
    changes in relative cortex size; however, our analysis indicates that
    this conclusion is not robust. Our finding that the coding regions of two
    widely expressed loci has experienced pervasive positive selection in
    relation to a complex, quantitative developmental phenotype provides a
    notable counterexample to the commonly asserted hypothesis that
    cis-regulatory regions play a dominant role in phenotypic evolution.>

    <bib-field|abstract|We have examined sperm morphology and dimensions in
    Eutherian mammals. In most Eutherians, sperm heads are round or oval and
    spermatozoa have short tails (average sperm length about 65 microns;
    range = 33-121 microns). Rodents, however, clearly depart from the
    typical Eutherian pattern in that they show a broad array of head morphs
    and an extreme range of sperm dimensions (35-250 microns). In order to
    trace the evolutionary changes that rodent sperm have undergone, we have
    used phylogenetic relationships based on biogeographical, morphological,
    chromosomal and genic data, and we have superimposed onto them the
    information available on sperm traits. Analyses were carried out for five
    rodent groups on which enough information was available. The evolutionary
    trends which emerged from these studies have two main points in common:
    throughout evolution spermatozoa have become enlarged and morphologically
    more complex, and this process seems to have taken place independently in
    different lineages. A general model was developed which outlines the
    different evolutionary pathways that rodent sperm have undergone. The
    adaptive significance of the increase in head complexity and the
    elongation of the sperm tail remains obscure. We have integrated
    information from evolutionary, physiological and behavioural studies to
    address this issue. We argue that two main selective forces may have
    favoured these changes: female selection within the reproductive tract
    and sperm competition. The female tract represents a formidable barrier
    for spermatozoa and its provides an environment where numerous
    interactions take place. The extent of these barriers and the complexity
    of these poorly understood interactions suggest that females may be
    exercising a strong selection, which may enable them to favour particular
    types of spermatozoa or ejaculates from particular males. Throughout
    their evolution males must have evolved adaptations to overcome these
    barriers, and the conflicting interests of choosy females. Sperm
    competition is a potent evolutionary force among mammals, which has
    influenced not only the evolution of sperm numbers but also changes in
    sperm dimensions. Thus, sperm competition has favoured the elongation of
    the sperm tail, which has led to the attainment of faster swimming speed,
    an important factor when sperm from rival males compete to reach the ova
    first.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Genes that belong to the same functional pathways are
    often packaged into operons in prokaryotes. However, aside from examples
    in nematode genomes, this form of transcriptional regulation appears to
    be absent in eukaryotes. Nevertheless, a number of recent studies have
    shown that gene order in eukaryotic genomes is not completely random, and
    that genes with similar expression patterns tend to be clustered
    together. What remains unclear is whether co-expressed genes have been
    gathered together by natural selection to facilitate their regulation, or
    if the genes are co-expressed simply by virtue of their being close
    together in the genome. Here, we show that gene expression clusters tend
    to contain fewer chromosomal breakpoints between human and mouse than
    expected by chance, which indicates that they are being held together by
    natural selection. This conclusion applies to clusters defined on the
    basis of broad (housekeeping) expression, or on the basis of correlated
    transcription profiles across tissues. Contrary to previous reports, we
    find that genes with high expression are not clustered to a greater
    extent than expected by chance and are not conserved during evolution.>

    <bib-field|abstract|A growing number of genes involved in sex and
    reproduction have been demonstrated to be rapidly evolving. Here, we show
    that genes expressed solely in spermatozoa represent a highly diverged
    subset among mouse and human tissue-specific orthologs. The average rate
    of nonsynonymous substitutions per site (K(a)) is significantly higher in
    sperm proteins (mean K(a) = 0.18; N = 35) than in proteins expressed
    specifically in all other tissues (mean K(a) = 0.074; N = 473). No
    differences, however, are found in the synonymous substitution rate
    (K(s)) between tissues, suggesting that selective forces, and not
    mutation rate, explain the high rate of replacement substitutions in
    sperm proteins. Four out of 19 sperm-specific genes with characterized
    function demonstrated evidence of strong positive Darwinian selection,
    including a protein involved in gene regulation, Protamine-1 (PRM1), a
    protein involved in glycolysis, GAPDS, and two egg-binding proteins,
    Adam-2 precursor (ADAM2) and sperm-adhesion molecule-1 (SAM1). These
    results demonstrate the rapid evolution of sperm-specific genes and
    highlight the molecular action of sexual selection on a variety of
    characters involved in mammalian sperm function.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Some introduced ant populations have an extraordinary
    social organization, called unicoloniality, whereby individuals mix
    freely within large supercolonies. We investigated whether this mode of
    social organization also exists in native populations of the Argentine
    ant Linepithema humile. Behavioral analyses revealed the presence of 11
    supercolonies (width 1 to 515 m) over a 3-km transect. As in the
    introduced range, there was always strong aggression between but never
    within supercolonies. The genetic data were in perfect agreement with the
    behavioral tests, all nests being assigned to identical supercolonies
    with the different methods. There was strong genetic differentiation
    between supercolonies but no genetic differentiation among nests within
    supercolonies. We never found more than a single mitochondrial haplotype
    per supercolony, further supporting the view that supercolonies are
    closed breeding units. Genetic and chemical distances between
    supercolonies were positively correlated, but there were no other
    significant associations between geographic, genetic, chemical, and
    behavioral distances. A comparison of supercolonies sampled in 1999 and
    2005 revealed a very high turnover, with about one-third of the
    supercolonies being replaced yearly. This dynamic is likely to involve
    strong competition between supercolonies and thus act as a potent
    selective force maintaining unicoloniality over evolutionary time.>

    <bib-field|abstract|It has been suggested that humans may suffer a high
    genomic deleterious mutation rate. Here we test this hypothesis by
    applying a variant of a molecular approach to estimate the deleterious
    mutation rate in hominids from the level of selective constraint in DNA
    sequences. Under conservative assumptions, we estimate that an average of
    4.2 amino-acid-altering mutations per diploid per generation have
    occurred in the human lineage since humans separated from chimpanzees. Of
    these mutations, we estimate that at least 38\\% have been eliminated by
    natural selection, indicating that there have been more than 1.6 new
    deleterious mutations per diploid genome per generation. Thus, the
    deleterious mutation rate specific to protein-coding sequences alone is
    close to the upper limit tolerable by a species such as humans that has a
    low reproductive rate, indicating that the effects of deleterious
    mutations may have combined synergistically. Furthermore, the level of
    selective constraint in hominid protein-coding sequences is atypically
    low. A large number of slightly deleterious mutations may therefore have
    become fixed in hominid lineages.>

    <bib-field|abstract|We report the 207-Mb genome sequence of the North

    coverage. We predict 32,670 genes in this outcrossing species compared to
    the 27,025 genes in the selfing species Arabidopsis thaliana. The much
    smaller 125-Mb genome of A. thaliana, which diverged from A. lyrata 10
    million years ago, likely constitutes the derived state for the family.
    We found evidence for DNA loss from large-scale rearrangements, but most
    of the difference in genome size can be attributed to hundreds of
    thousands of small deletions, mostly in noncoding DNA and transposons.
    Analysis of deletions and insertions still segregating in A. thaliana
    indicates that the process of DNA loss is ongoing, suggesting pervasive

    <bib-field|abstract|Evolutionary theory predicts that sexually
    antagonistic loci will be preferentially sex-linked, and this association
    can be empirically testes with data on sex-biased gene expression with
    the assumption that sex-biased gene expression represents the resolution
    of past sexual antagonism. However, incomplete dosage compensating
    mechanisms and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation have hampered efforts
    to connect expression data to theoretical predictions regarding the
    genomic distribution of sexually antagonistic loci in a variety of
    animals. Here we use data on the underlying regulatory mechanism that
    produce expression sex-bias to test the genomic distribution of sexually
    antagonistic genes in chicken. Using this approach, which is free from
    problems associated with the lack of dosage compensation in birds, we
    show that female-detriment genes are significantly overrepresented on the
    Z chromosome, and female-benefit genes underrepresented. By contrast,
    male-effect genes show no over- or underrepresentation on the Z
    chromosome. These data are consistent with a dominant mode of inheritance
    for sexually antagonistic genes, in which male-benefit coding mutations
    are more likely to be fixed on the Z due to stronger male-specific
    selective pressures. After fixation of male-benefit alleles, regulatory
    changes in females evolve to minimize antagonism by reducing female
    expression.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The fossil record preserves numerous natural
    experiments that can shed light on the response of ecological communities
    to environmental change. However, directly observing the community
    dynamics of extinct organisms is not possible. As an alternative, neutral
    ecological models suggest that species abundance distributions reflect
    dynamical processes like migration, competition, recruitment, and
    extinction. Live-dead comparisons suggest that such distributions can be
    faithfully preserved in the rock record. Here we use a maximum-likelihood
    approach to show that brachiopod (lamp shell) abundance distributions
    from four temporally distinct ecological landscapes from the Glass
    Mountains, Texas (of the Permian period), exhibit significant
    differences. Further, all four are better fitted by zero-sum multinomial
    distributions, characteristic of Hubbell's neutral model, than by
    log-normal distributions, as predicted by the traditional ecological null
    hypothesis. Using the neutral model as a guide, we suggest that sea level
    fluctuations spanning about 10 Myr altered the degrees of isolation and
    exchange among local communities within these ecological landscapes.
    Neither these long-term environmental changes nor higher-frequency sea
    level fluctuations resulted in wholesale extinction or major innovation
    within evolutionary lineages.>

    <bib-field|abstract|In a previous work we have defined the number and the
    functional classes of genes under positive selection and relaxation in
    human, chimpancee and their common ancestral primate lineage (Arbiza, et
    al. 2006). As many others authors interested in the action of natural
    selection in the human genome we've described a few number of genes
    evolving adaptively, although a higher numder were found under a weak
    selection and/or relaxation of selective constraints. Moreover, we
    concluded that the relative number of genes belonging to different
    functional classes among different lineages were similar for any of the
    evolutionaryregimes studied. Now we extend this study to all the branches
    of the phylogenetic tree relating human, chimpancee, macaca, mouse, rat
    and dog. We search the changes in the selective constraints that have
    ocurred in different functional classes of this phylogeny. We will
    overview all the major differences in selective changes for functional
    classes of genes changing during lineage evolution. We found that
    adaptative events occured in proteins are at expenses of neutral sites
    and not on those belonging to the class of sites under purifying

    <bib-field|abstract|The extent to which "developmental constraints" in
    complex organisms restrict evolutionary directions remains contentious.
    Yet, other forms of internal constraint, which have received less
    attention, may also exist. It will be argued here that a set of partial
    constraints below the level of phenotypes, those involving genes and
    molecules, influences and channels the set of possible evolutionary
    trajectories. At the top-most organizational level there are the genetic
    network modules, whose operations directly underlie complex morphological
    traits. The properties of these network modules, however, have themselves
    been set by the evolutionary history of the component genes and their
    interactions. Characterization of the components, structures, and
    operational dynamics of specific genetic networks should lead to a better
    understanding not only of the morphological traits they underlie but of
    the biases that influence the directions of evolutionary change.
    Furthermore, such knowledge may permit assessment of the relative degrees
    of probability of short evolutionary trajectories, those on the
    microevolutionary scale. In effect, a "network perspective" may help
    transform evolutionary biology into a scientific enterprise with greater
    predictive capability than it has hitherto possessed.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Genomic duplication-divergence processes are the
    primary source of new protein functions and thereby contribute to the
    evolutionary expansion of functional molecular networks. Yet, it is still
    unclear to what extent such duplication-divergence processes also
    restrict by construction the emerging properties of molecular networks,
    regardless of any specific cellular functions. We address this question,
    here, focusing on the evolution of protein-protein interaction (PPI)
    networks. We solve a general duplication-divergence model, based on the
    statistically necessary deletions of protein-protein interactions arising
    from stochastic duplications at various genomic scales, from single-gene
    to whole-genome duplications. Major evolutionary scenarios are shown to
    depend on two global parameters only: (i) a protein conservation index
    (M), which controls the evolutionary history of PPI networks, and (ii) a
    distinct topology index (M') controlling their resulting structure. We
    then demonstrate that conserved, nondense networks, which are of prime
    biological relevance, are also necessarily scale-free by construction,
    irrespective of any evolutionary variations or fluctuations of the model
    parameters. It is shown to result from a fundamental linkage between
    individual protein conservation and network topology under general
    duplication-divergence evolution. By contrast, we find that conservation
    of network motifs with two or more proteins cannot be indefinitely
    preserved under general duplication-divergence evolution (independently
    from any network rewiring dynamics), in broad agreement with empirical
    evidence between phylogenetically distant species. All in all, these
    evolutionary constraints, inherent to duplication-divergence processes,
    appear to have largely controlled the overall topology and
    scale-dependent conservation of PPI networks, regardless of any specific
    biological function.>

    <bib-field|abstract|In recent years there has been a flurry of works on
    learning probabilistic belief networks. Current state of the art methods
    have been shown to be successful for two learning scenarios: learning
    both network structure and parameters from complete data, and learning
    parameters for a fixed network from incomplete data—that is, in the
    presence of missing values —or hidden variables. However, no method has
    yet been demonstrated to effectively learn network structure from
    incomplete data. In this paper, we propose a new method for learning
    network structure from incomplete data. This method is based on an
    extension of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for model
    selection problems that performs search for the best structure inside the
    EM procedure. We prove the convergence of this algorithm, and adapt it
    for learning belief networks. We then describe how to learn networks in
    two scenarios: when the data contains missing values, and in the presence
    of hidden variables. We provide experimental results that show the
    effectiveness of our procedure in both scenarios.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Similarity in gene expression pattern between closely
    linked genes is known in several eukaryotes. Two models have been
    proposed to explain the presence of such coexpression patterns. The
    adaptive model assumes that coexpression is advantageous and is
    established by relocation of initially unlinked but coexpressed genes,
    whereas the neutral model asserts that coexpression is a type of leaky
    expression due to similar expressional environments of linked genes, but
    is neither advantageous nor detrimental. However, these models are
    incompatible with several empirical observations. Here, we propose that
    coexpression of linked genes is a form of transcriptional interference
    that is disadvantageous to the organism. We show that even distantly
    linked genes that are tens of megabases away exhibit significant
    coexpression in the human genome. However, the linkage is more likely to
    be broken during evolution between genes of high coexpression than those
    of low coexpression and the breakage of linkage reduces gene
    coexpression. These results support our hypothesis that coexpression of
    linked genes in mammalian genomes is generally disadvantageous, implying
    that many mammalian genes may never reach their optimal expression
    pattern due to the interference of their genomic environment and that
    such transcriptional interference may be a force promoting recurrent
    relocation of genes in the genome. 10.1093/molbev/msn101>

    drawback of requiring a complete and exact mapping of terminal nodes

    discarded. To overcome this, we have developed treeKO, an algorithm that
    enables the comparison of tree topologies, even in the presence of
    duplication and loss events. To do so treeKO recursively splits gene
    trees into pruned trees containing only orthologs to subsequently compute
    a distance based on the combined analyses of all pruned tree comparisons.
    In addition treeKO, implements the possibility of computing phylome

    <bib-field|abstract|Functional divergence between homologous proteins is
    expected to affect amino acid sequences in two main ways, which can be
    considered as proxies of biochemical divergence: a "covarion-like"
    pattern of correlated changes in evolutionary rates, and switches in
    conserved residues ("conserved but different"). While these patterns have
    been used in case studies, a large-scale analysis is needed to estimate
    their frequency and distribution. We use a phylogenomic framework of
    animal genes to answer three questions: 1) What is the prevalence of such
    patterns? 2) Can we link such patterns at the amino acid level with
    selection inferred at the codon level? And 3) are patterns different
    between paralogs and orthologs? We find that "covarion-like" patterns are
    more frequently detected than "constant-but-different", but that only the
    latter are correlated with signal for positive selection. Finally, there
    is no obvious difference in patterns between orthologs and paralogs.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Reproductive proteins often diverge rapidly between
    species. This pattern is frequently attributed to postmating sexual
    selection. Heliconius butterflies offer a good opportunity to examine
    this hypothesis by contrasting patterns of reproductive protein evolution
    between clades with divergent mating systems. Pupal-mating Heliconius
    females typically mate only once, limiting opportunity for postmating
    sexual selection. In contrast, adult-mating females remate throughout
    life. Reproductive protein evolution is therefore predicted to be slower
    and show little evidence of positive selection in the pupal-mating clade.
    We examined this prediction by sequencing 18 seminal fluid protein genes
    from a dozen Heliconius species and a related outgroup. Two proteins
    exhibited dN/dS \> 1, implicating positive selection in the rapid
    evolution of at least a few Heliconius seminal fluid proteins. However,
    contrary to predictions, the average evolutionary rate of seminal fluid
    proteins was greater among pupal-mating Heliconius. Based on these
    results, we suggest that positive selection and relaxed constraint can
    generate conflicting patterns of reproductive protein evolution between
    mating systems. As predicted, some loci may show elevated evolutionary
    rates in promiscuous taxa relative to monandrous taxa resulting from
    adaptations to postmating sexual selection. However, when monandry is
    derived (as in Heliconius), the opposite pattern may result from relaxed
    selective constraints.>

    <bib-field|abstract|A growing body of evidence suggests that DNA
    methylation is functionally divergent among different taxa. The recently
    discovered functional methylation system in the honeybee Apis mellifera
    presents an attractive invertebrate model system to study evolution and
    function of DNA methylation. In the honeybee, DNA methylation is mostly
    targeted toward transcription units (gene bodies) of a subset of genes.
    Here, we report an intriguing covariation of length and epigenetic status
    of honeybee genes. Hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes in honeybee
    are dramatically different in their lengths for both exons and introns.
    By analyzing orthologs in Drosophila melanogaster, Acyrthosiphon pisum,
    and Ciona intestinalis, we show genes that were short and long in the
    past are now preferentially situated in hyper- and hypomethylated classes
    respectively, in the honeybee. Moreover, we demonstrate that a subset of
    high-CpG genes are conspicuously longer than expected under the
    evolutionary relationship alone and that they are enriched in specific
    functional categories. We suggest that gene length evolution in the
    honeybee is partially driven by evolutionary forces related to regulation
    of gene expression, which in turn is associated with DNA methylation.
    However, lineage-specific patterns of gene length evolution suggest that
    there may exist additional forces underlying the observed interaction
    between DNA methylation and gene lengths in the honeybee.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Basic nuclear proteins were isolated from the sperm
    of the Syrian hamster Mesocricetus auratus and characterized by gel
    electrophoresis, amino acid analysis, and sequencing. Analyses of the
    proteins by gel electrophoresis show that sperm of this species contain
    both protamines 1 and 2. The two proteins were purified by HPLC and the
    complete primary sequence of hamster protamine 1 was determined by
    automated amino acid sequence analysis. The protein sequence was
    subsequently confirmed by sequencing the PCR-amplified protamine 1 gene.
    The first forty-two residues of the hamster protamine 2 sequence were
    obtained by amino acid sequence analysis of the isolated protein, and
    this sequence was also confirmed and extended by sequencing the gene.
    Total basic nuclear protein was also isolated from sperm of six other
    species of hamsters, the protamines were identified by HPLC and amino
    acid analysis, and the proportion of protamines 1 and 2 in each species
    was determined. Marked differences in the protamine 2 content of sperm
    were observed among the different species of hamster. This variation and
    the high level of sequence similarity between mouse and hamster
    protamines provide insight into how the two protamines may be organized
    in sperm chromatin. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 54:273-282, 1999. Published 1999

    <bib-field|abstract|As the utility of the neutral theory of biodiversity
    is increasingly being recognized, there is also an increasing need for
    proper tools to evaluate the relative importance of neutral processes
    (dispersal limitation and stochasticity). One of the key features of
    neutral theory is its close link to data: sampling formulas, giving the
    probability of a data set conditional on a set of model parameters, have
    been developed for parameter estimation and model comparison. However,
    only single local samples can be handled with the currently available
    sampling formulas, whereas data are often available for many small
    spatially separated plots. Here, I present a sampling formula for
    multiple, spatially separated samples from the same metacommunity, which
    is a generalization of earlier sampling formulas. I also provide an
    algorithm to generate data sets with the model and I introduce a general
    test of neutrality that does not require an alternative model; this test
    compares the probability of the observed data (calculated using the new
    sampling formula) with the probability of model-generated data sets. I
    illustrate this with tree abundance data from three large Panamanian
    neotropical forest plots. When the test is performed with model
    parameters estimated from the three plots, the model cannot be rejected;
    however, when parameter estimates previously reported for BCI are used,
    the model is strongly rejected. This suggests that neutrality cannot
    explain the structure of the three Panamanian tree communities on the
    local (BCI) and regional (Panama Canal Zone) scale simultaneously. One
    should be aware, however, that aspects of the model other than neutrality
    may be responsible for its failure. I argue that the spatially implicit
    character of the model is a potential candidate.>

    tools for molecular evolution, phylogenetics, phylogenomics and
    hypotheses testing. It has been designed as a response to the increasing
    demand of molecular sequence analyses for experts and non-expert users.
    Phylemon 2.0 has several unique features that differentiates it from
    other similar web resources: (i) it offers an integrated environment that
    enables evolutionary analyses, format conversion, file storage and
    edition of results; (ii) it suggests further analyses, thereby guiding
    the users through the web server; and (iii) it allows users to design and
    save phylogenetic pipelines to be used over multiple genes
    (phylogenomics). Altogether, Phylemon 2.0 integrates a suite of 30 tools
    covering sequence alignment reconstruction and trimming; tree
    reconstruction, visualization and manipulation; and evolutionary

    <bib-field|abstract|The nonsynonymous (amino acid-altering) to synonymous
    (silent) substitution rate ratio (omega = d(N)/d(S)) provides a measure
    of natural selection at the protein level, with omega = 1, \>1, and \<1,
    indicating neutral evolution, purifying selection, and positive
    selection, respectively. Previous studies that used this measure to
    detect positive selection have often taken an approach of pairwise
    comparison, estimating substitution rates by averaging over all sites in
    the protein. As most amino acids in a functional protein are under
    structural and functional constraints and adaptive evolution probably
    affects only a few sites at a few time points, this approach of averaging
    rates over sites and over time has little power. Previously, we developed
    codon-based substitution models that allow the omega ratio to vary either
    among lineages or among sites. In this paper we extend previous models to
    allow the omega ratio to vary both among sites and among lineages and
    implement the new models in the likelihood framework. These models may be
    useful for identifying positive selection along prespecified lineages
    that affects only a few sites in the protein. We apply those branch-site
    models as well as previous branch- and site-specific models to three data
    sets: the lysozyme genes from primates, the tumor suppressor BRCA1 genes
    from primates, and the phytochrome (PHY) gene family in angiosperms.
    Positive selection is detected in the lysozyme and BRCA genes by both the
    new and the old models. However, only the new models detected positive
    selection acting on lineages after gene duplication in the PHY gene
    family. Additional tests on several data sets suggest that the new models
    may be useful in detecting positive selection after gene duplication in
    gene family evolution.>

    <bib-field|abstract|We describe Hi-C, a method that probes the
    three-dimensional architecture of whole genomes by coupling
    proximity-based ligation with massively parallel sequencing. We
    constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C at a
    resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome
    territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We
    identified an additional level of genome organization that is
    characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to
    form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin
    conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer
    conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the
    ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule
    is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our
    results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of
    whole genomes.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Conventional genetic theories have failed to explain
    why cancer (1) is not heritable and thus extremely rare in newborns, (2)
    is caused by non-mutagenic carcinogens, (3) develops only years to
    decades after initiation by carcinogens, (4) follows pre-neoplastic
    aneuploidy, (5) is aneuploid, (6) is chromosomally and phenotypically
    "unstable", (7) carries specific aneusomies, (8) generates much more
    complex phenotypes than conventional mutation such as multidrug
    resistance, (9) generates nonselective phenotypes such as metastasis (no
    benefit at native site) and "immortality" (not necessary for
    tumorigenesis), and (10) does not contain carcinogenic mutations. We
    propose, instead, that cancer is a chromosomal disease. Accordingly
    carcinogenesis is initiated by random aneuploidies, which are induced by
    carcinogens or spontaneously. Since aneuploidy unbalances 1000s of genes,
    it corrupts teams of proteins that segregate, synthesize and repair
    chromosomes. Aneuploidy is therefore a steady source of chromosomal
    variations from which, in classical Darwinian terms, selection encourages
    the evolution and malignant progression of cancer cells. The rates of
    specific chromosomal variations can exceed conventional mutations by 4-11
    orders of magnitude, depending on the degrees of aneuploidy. Based on
    their chromosomal constitution cancer cells are new cell "species" with
    specific aneusomies, but unstable karyotypes. The cancer-specific
    aneusomies generate complex, malignant phenotypes through the abnormal
    dosages of 1000s of genes, just as trisomy 21 generates Down syndrome. In
    sum, cancer is caused by chromosomal disorganization, which increases
    karyotypic entropy. Thus, cancer is a chromosomal rather than a genetic
    disease. The chromosomal theory explains (1) non-heritable cancer because
    aneuploidy is not heritable, (2) non-mutagenic carcinogens as
    aneuploidogens, (3) long neoplastic latencies by the low probability of
    evolving new species, (4) nonselective phenotypes via genes hitchhiking
    with selective chromosomes, and (5) immortality because, through their
    cellular heterogeneity, cancers survive negative mutations and cytotoxic
    drugs via resistant subspecies.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Next-generation sequencing has opened the door to
    genomic analysis of nonmodel organisms. Technologies generating
    long-sequence reads (200-400 bp) are increasingly used in evolutionary
    studies of nonmodel organisms, but the short-sequence reads (30-50 bp)
    that can be produced at lower cost are thought to be of limited utility
    for de novo sequencing applications. Here, we tested this assumption by
    short-read sequencing the transcriptomes of the tropical disease vectors
    Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, for which complete genome sequences
    are available. Comparison of our results to the reference genomes allowed
    us to accurately evaluate the quantity, quality, and functional and
    evolutionary information content of our "test" data. We produced more
    than 0.7 billion nucleotides of sequenced data per species that assembled
    into more than 21,000 test contigs larger than 100 bp per species and
    covered approximately 27\\% of the Aedes reference transcriptome.
    Remarkably, the substitution error rate in the test contigs was
    approximately 0.25\\% per site, with very few indels or assembly errors.
    Test contigs of both species were enriched for genes involved in energy
    production and protein synthesis and underrepresented in genes involved
    in transcription and differentiation. Ortholog prediction using the test
    contigs was accurate across hundreds of millions of years of evolution.
    Our results demonstrate the considerable utility of short-read
    transcriptome sequencing for genomic studies of nonmodel organisms and
    suggest an approach for assessing the information content of
    next-generation data for evolutionary studies.>

    <bib-field|abstract|With the recent increase in the number of mammalian
    genomes being sequenced, large-scale genome scans for human-specific
    positive selection are now possible. Selection can be inferred through
    phylogenetic analysis by comparing the rates of silent and replacement
    substitution between related species. Maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of
    codon substitution models can be used to identify genes with an
    accelerated pattern of amino acid substitution on a particular lineage.
    However, the ML methods are computationally intensive and awkward to
    configure. We have created a database that contains the results of tests
    for positive selection along the human lineage in 13,721 genes with
    orthologs in the UCSC multispecies genome alignments. The Human PAML
    Browser is a resource through which researchers can search for a gene of
    interest or groups of genes by Gene Ontology category, and obtain coding
    sequence alignments for the gene and as well as results from tests of
    positive selection from the software package Phylogenetic Analysis by
    Maximum Likelihood. The Human PAML Browser is available at

    <bib-field|abstract|A major goal in human genetics is to understand the
    role of common genetic variants in susceptibility to common diseases.
    This will require characterizing the nature of gene variation in human
    populations, assembling an extensive catalogue of single-nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes and performing association
    studies for particular diseases. At present, our knowledge of human gene
    variation remains rudimentary. Here we describe a systematic survey of
    SNPs in the coding regions of human genes. We identified SNPs in 106
    genes relevant to cardiovascular disease, endocrinology and
    neuropsychiatry by screening an average of 114 independent alleles using
    2 independent screening methods. To ensure high accuracy, all reported
    SNPs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. We identified 560 SNPs, including
    392 coding-region SNPs (cSNPs) divided roughly equally between those
    causing synonymous and non-synonymous changes. We observed different
    rates of polymorphism among classes of sites within genes (non-coding,
    degenerate and non-degenerate) as well as between genes. The cSNPs most
    likely to influence disease, those that alter the amino acid sequence of
    the encoded protein, are found at a lower rate and with lower allele
    frequencies than silent substitutions. This likely reflects selection
    acting against deleterious alleles during human evolution. The lower
    allele frequency of missense cSNPs has implications for the compilation
    of a comprehensive catalogue, as well as for the subsequent application
    to disease association.>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: Phylogenomics analyses serve to establish
    evolutionary relationships among organisms and their genes. A phylome,
    the complete collection of all gene phylogenies in a genome, constitutes
    a valuable source of information, but its use in large genomes still
    constitutes a technical challenge. The use of phylomes also requires the
    development of new methods that help us to interpret them. RESULTS: We
    reconstruct here the human phylome, which includes the evolutionary
    relationships of all human proteins and their homologs among 39 fully
    sequenced eukaryotes. Phylogenetic techniques used include alignment
    trimming, branch length optimization, evolutionary model testing and
    maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Although differences with
    alternative topologies are minor, most of the trees support the Coelomata
    and Unikont hypotheses as well as the grouping of primates with
    laurasatheria to the exclusion of rodents. We assess the extent of gene
    duplication events and their relationship with the functional roles of
    the protein families involved. We find support for at least one, and
    probably two, rounds of whole genome duplications before vertebrate
    radiation. Using a novel algorithm that is independent from a species
    phylogeny, we derive orthology and paralogy relationships of human
    proteins among eukaryotic genomes. CONCLUSION: Topological variations
    among phylogenies for different genes are to be expected, highlighting
    the danger of gene-sampling effects in phylogenomic analyses. Several
    links can be established between the functions of gene families
    duplicated at certain phylogenetic splits and major evolutionary
    transitions in those lineages. The pipeline implemented here can be
    easily adapted for use in other organisms.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Protamines are the major DNA-binding proteins in the
    nucleus of sperm in most vertebrates and package the DNA in a volume less
    than 5\\% of a somatic cell nucleus. Many mammals have one protamine, but
    a few species, including humans and mice, have two. Here we use gene
    targeting to determine if the second protamine provides redundancy to an
    essential process, or if both protamines are necessary. We disrupted the
    coding sequence of one allele of either Prm1 or Prm2 in embryonic stem
    (ES) cells derived from 129-strain mice, and injected them into
    blastocysts from C57BL/6-strain mice. Male chimeras produced 129-genotype
    sperm with disrupted Prm1 or Prm2 alleles, but failed to sire offspring
    carrying the 129 genome. We also found that a decrease in the amount of
    either protamine disrupts nuclear formation, processing of protamine-2
    and normal sperm function. Our studies show that both protamines are
    essential and that haploinsufficiency caused by a mutation in one allele
    of Prm1 or Prm2 prevents genetic transmission of both mutant and
    wild-type alleles.>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of functional site
    turnover has important implications for the study of regulatory region
    evolution, such as for promoter sequence alignments and transcription
    factor binding site (TFBS) identification. At present, it remains
    difficult to estimate TFBS turnover rates on real genomic sequences, as
    reliable mappings of functional sites across related species are often
    not available. As an alternative, we introduce a flexible new simulation
    system, Phylogenetic Simulation of Promoter Evolution (PSPE), designed to
    study functional site turnovers in regulatory sequences. RESULTS: Using
    PSPE, we study replacement turnover rates of different individual TFBSs
    and simple modules of two sites under neutral evolutionary functional
    constraints. We find that TFBS replacement turnover can happen rapidly in
    promoters, and turnover rates vary significantly among different TFBSs
    and modules. We assess the influence of different constraints such as
    insertion/deletion rate and translocation distances. Complementing the
    simulations, we give simple but effective mathematical models for TFBS
    turnover rate prediction. As one important application of PSPE, we also
    present a first systematic evaluation of multiple sequence aligners
    regarding their capability of detecting TFBSs in promoters with site
    turnovers. CONCLUSION: PSPE allows researchers for the first time to
    investigate TFBS replacement turnovers in promoters systematically. The
    assessment of alignment tools points out the limitations of current
    approaches to identify TFBSs in non-coding sequences, where turnover
    events of functional sites may happen frequently, and where we are
    interested in assessing the similarity on the functional level. PSPE is
    freely available at the authors' website.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Duplication of genes, giving rise to multigene
    families, has been a characteristic feature of the evolution of
    eukaryotic genomes. In the case of vertebrates, it has been proposed that
    an increase in gene number resulted from two rounds of duplication of the
    entire genome by polyploidization (the 2R hypothesis). In the most
    extensive test to date of this hypothesis, we compared gene numbers in
    homologous families and conducted phylogenetic analyses of gene families
    with two to eight members in the complete genomes of Caenorhabditis
    elegans and Drosophila melanogaster and the available portion of the
    human genome. Although the human genome showed a higher proportion of
    recent gene duplications than the other animal genomes, the proportion of
    duplications after the deuterostome-protostome split was constant across
    families, with no peak of such duplications in four-member families,
    contrary to the expectation of the 2R hypothesis. A substantial majority
    (70.9\\%) of human four-member families and four-member clusters in
    larger families showed topologies inconsistent with two rounds of
    polyploidization in vertebrates.>

    spectrum in genome biology. For gene sequencers, the vast stretches of
    non-coding DNA found in eukaryotic genomes were largely considered to be
    an annoyance, whereas genome-size researchers attributed little relevance
    to specific nucleotide sequences. However, the dawn of comprehensive
    genome sequencing has allowed a new synergy between these fields, with
    sequence data providing novel insights into genome-size evolution, and
    with genome-size data being of both practical and theoretical
    significance for large-scale sequence analysis. In combination, these
    formerly disconnected disciplines are poised to deliver a greatly
    improved understanding of genome structure and evolution.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Human genetic variation is expected to play a central
    role in personalized medicine. Yet only a fraction of the natural genetic
    variation that is harbored by humans has been discovered to date. Here we
    report almost 2 million small insertions and deletions (INDELs) that
    range from 1 bp to 10,000 bp in length in the genomes of 79 diverse
    humans. These variants include 819,363 small INDELs that map to human
    genes. Small INDELs frequently were found in the coding exons of these
    genes, and several lines of evidence indicate that such variation is a
    major determinant of human biological diversity. Microarray-based
    genotyping experiments revealed several interesting observations
    regarding the population genetics of small INDEL variation. For example,
    we found that many of our INDELs had high levels of linkage
    disequilibrium (LD) with both HapMap SNPs and with high-scoring SNPs from
    genome-wide association studies. Overall, our study indicates that small
    INDEL variation is likely to be a key factor underlying inherited traits
    and diseases in humans.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The relationship between rates of genomic evolution
    and organismal adaptation remains uncertain, despite considerable
    interest. The feasibility of obtaining genome sequences from
    experimentally evolving populations offers the opportunity to investigate
    this relationship with new precision. Here we sequence genomes sampled
    through 40,000 generations from a laboratory population of Escherichia
    coli. Although adaptation decelerated sharply, genomic evolution was
    nearly constant for 20,000 generations. Such clock-like regularity is
    usually viewed as the signature of neutral evolution, but several lines
    of evidence indicate that almost all of these mutations were beneficial.
    This same population later evolved an elevated mutation rate and
    accumulated hundreds of additional mutations dominated by a neutral
    signature. Thus, the coupling between genomic and adaptive evolution is
    complex and can be counterintuitive even in a constant environment. In
    particular, beneficial substitutions were surprisingly uniform over time,
    whereas neutral substitutions were highly variable.>

    <bib-field|abstract|As genomic sequences become easier to acquire,
    shotgun proteomics will play an increasingly important role in genome
    annotation. With proteomics, researchers can confirm and revise existing
    genome annotations and discover completely new genes. Proteomic-based de
    novo gene discovery should be especially useful for sets of genes with
    characteristics that make them difficult to predict with gene-finding
    algorithms. Here, we report the proteomic discovery of 19 previously
    unannotated genes encoding seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) that are
    transferred from males to females during mating in Drosophila. Using
    bioinformatics, we detected putative orthologs of these genes, as well as
    19 others detected by the same method in a previous study, across several
    related species. Gene expression analysis revealed that nearly all
    predicted orthologs are transcribed and that most are expressed in a
    male-specific or male-biased manner. We suggest several reasons why these
    genes escaped computational prediction. Like annotated Sfps, many of
    these new proteins show a pattern of adaptive evolution, consistent with
    their potential role in influencing male sperm competitive ability.
    However, in contrast to annotated Sfps, these new genes are shorter, have
    a higher rate of nonsynonymous substitution, and have a markedly lower GC
    content in coding regions. Our data demonstrate the utility of applying
    proteomic gene discovery methods to a specific biological process and
    provide a more complete picture of the molecules that are critical to
    reproductive success in Drosophila.>

    design by making sperm longer and more hydrodynamic in order to achieve
    faster swimming speeds, the main determinant of fertilisation success in
    competitive contexts. However, the evidence for mammals is contentious.
    We compare patterns of sperm evolution among different mammalian taxa and
    show that, while some lineages respond to increased levels of sperm
    competition by increasing sperm size and modifying sperm head shape,
    others do not. Among the latter taxa, sperm size is unrelated to sperm
    competition levels, but is associated with body size. In addition, we
    compare the rate of evolution of reproductive genes for mammalian taxa,
    and also find differences in evolutionary patterns between lineages. We
    suggest that differences between mammalian taxa in life-history (largely
    body size-dependent), mating system and population dynamics may explain
    both phenotypic and molecular evolutionary patterns. Funded by the

    <bib-field|abstract|It is often stated that patterns of nonsynonymous
    rate variation among mammalian lineages are more irregular than expected
    or overdispersed under the neutral model, whereas synonymous sites
    conform to the neutral model. Here we reexamined genome-wide patterns of
    the variance to mean ratio, or index of dispersion (R), of substitutions
    in proteins from human, mouse, and dog. Contrary to the prevailing
    notion, we found that the mean index of dispersion for nonsynonymous
    sites of mammalian proteins is not significantly different from 1. We
    propose that earlier analyses were biased because the data included
    disproportionately more protein hormones, which tend to be more dispersed
    than genes in other functional categories. Synonymous sites exhibit
    greater degree of dispersion than nonsynonymous sites, although similar
    to earlier estimates and potentially due to errors associated with
    correction for multiple hits. Overall, our analysis identifies strong
    genome-wide generation-time effect and natural selection as important
    determinants of among-lineage variation of protein evolutionary rates.
    Furthermore, patterns of lineage-specific selective constraint are
    consistent with the nearly neutral model of molecular evolution.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Background: MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding
    RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression in a sequence- specific
    manner. Post-transcriptional silencing of target genes by miRNA occurs
    either by specific cleavage of homologous mRNA or by specific inhibition
    of protein synthesis. MiRNAs are essential regulators of various
    processes such as proliferation, differentiation, development, cell death
    and interaction between virus and host cell. Aim: The aim of this paper
    is to summarize the main findings from research on miRNA biogenesis,
    functionality and cancer relevance. Method: A narrative literature review
    of all of the relevant papers known to the authors was conducted.
    Results: Several human diseases including cancer are associated with
    aberrant regulation of miRNAs expression or deficiency in miRNA
    biogenesis. Analysis of miRNA expression signatures can serve as a
    valuable tool for cancer classification, diagnostics and prediction of
    tumor behavior. Conclusions: There has been demonstrated a possibility to
    use these microRNA signatures for a specific cancer classification with
    potential predictive and therapeutic value. The known data provide
    evidence that microRNAs may open new ways for cancer diagnosis, prognosis
    estimation and therapy.>

    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \nThe autors present here two versions of a bioinformatic
    pipeline ebding in the detectino events of positive selection at
    branch-site level using existing databases. The pipeline is dependant of
    the database used.\n277.318 and 25.272 jobs (branches tested)\n\n
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \nthey archieve an improvment of 7\\% in computation time,
    and argue that their results "shed light on the evolution of
    protein-coding genes in vertebrates"\n\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \n\n
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \n\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \n\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Intro:\n
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \n\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ l55-60 problem with alignments: error,
    putative predicted genes, longest transcript.\n\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ l73-75
    datasets: i) bs-test on all internal branches of TreeFamA+B ii)better
    data quality filter to apply to ensembl gene trees\n\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \n
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \nMethod:\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \n\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ l85-89
    protein alignments retrieved form treefam and used to infer DNA
    alignments. Cleanned with Gblocks strict filtering. extract vertebrate
    subtrees with 4 or more species. This step is not sufficiently explained,
    are the alignments retrieved from TreeFam already cleanned (using Gblocks
    on an already cleanned alignment can bias the selection of bloks)? DNA
    alignments were deduced from protein alignment or retrieved also from
    TreeFam using the API? what exactly are the parameters used for Gbloks, i
    was unable to find a reference to "strict fitering" in Gblocks
    publications or manual, and no further explanation is given in
    supplementary material.\n\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Material and Supplementary
    Material general concern:\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \nphylogenetic input tree used
    as input for CodeML is not directly infered from the alignment. The
    additional filtering step of the pipeline (Gblocks or M-coffee cut-off
    score) may change the evolutionary history of corresponding gene. Tree
    topology may be affected and, if so, bias the estimation of selective
    pressure. In my sense a new estimation of the topology would be
    necessary. Specially in the case of filtering non-homologous exons.\n\n
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \n\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Results:\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \n\n
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Run1:\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \nIn my sense the first paragraph
    lines 105-113 could perfectly match in Material and methods.\nl 131 take
    home message is obvious\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \nBiological insight from Run
    1:\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \nThe results presented in table 2 are redundant in
    terms of annotation inheritance, perhaps they can be summarized to the
    level of annotation at which they are more significant.\n\n
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \nRun 2:\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \nThe idea of
    optimizing parameters with M0 model is a good aportation and seem to be
    some how efficient. however this methodology do not seem to avoid the
    problems of convergence pointed out by the autors. Z. Yang usually
    recommend to use different starting points for omega or kappa (PAML
    manual) in order to find the combination of parameters allowing the
    maximum likelihood. The methodolgy proposed is a bit more effeicient but
    seems to have the ability to find local maximas that corresponds to
    global maxima of M0 model. I would not recommend this methodolgy as is.
    \nIf computation time is an issue, an other way to do it could be tu run
    in a first time branch-site A and only run branch-site A1 for those
    groups of homologs where the foreground value of omega for site class 2a
    is higher than 1. This would certainly decrease computation time to
    almost 50\\%.\nBut whatever methodology is used models should be run at
    least twice with different starting values of omega (for branch-site A).
    In the case likelihoods are different between those runs, extra runs
    should be used in order to find at least two time the same likelihood.\nI
    would not expect to see the problems of non-identical results pointed out
    by the autors using the parameter of branch-site A as starting point for
    branch-site A1. We could even think to skip the different runs of codeml
    for branch-site A1 in this case, the differences betweens bsA and bsA1
    being only to fix one class of site in the foreground branch.\n\n
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \n\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Discussion:\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \nYes it
    would be really nice to speed up Codeml.\nI think the whole pipeline
    should be reconsider, starting from the use of a tree topology that is
    not infered from the same alignment used to infer positive selection.
    Also convergent problem should be corrected as suggested by the PAML's
    user guide running the same model with different starting values of omega
    kappa... Results from run 2 point that at least 22\\% of the estimations
    done by CodeML can not be fully optimize in a single run, in top of that
    as autor mention they run the models with the same starting value,
    changing starting values would increase this number.\nBranch-site test 2
    of positive selection is a very sensible test the repetitive run of each
    model is compulsory.\n\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \n\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \n\n
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \nTable 1 is not refered to in text\nTable 1 and Table 2
    could be reduced to significant terms after application of FDR\n\n
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \n\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Figure 2 B and C:\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \nIs a
    strange case given as example, non of the sites presented here to be
    under positive selection have a posterior probability higher than 0.95 to
    belong to site class 2.\n\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \n\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \n\n
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \n\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \nbsA1 only if bsA detects some sites of
    positive selection\n\n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \n\n \ \ \ \ \ >

    <bib-field|abstract|Ongoing efforts within synthetic and systems biology
    have been directed towards the building of artificial computational
    devices1 using engineered biological units as basic building blocks2,3
    efforts, inspired in the standard design of electronic circuits4–7 .
    Such , are limited by the difficulties arising from wiring the basic
    computa- tional units (logic gates) through the appropriate connections,
    each one to be implemented by a different molecule. Here, we show that
    there is a logically different form of implementing complex Boolean logic
    computations that reduces wiring constraints thanks to a redundant
    distributionof the desiredoutputamongengineered cells. A practical
    implementation is presented using a library of engineered yeast cells,
    which can be combined in multiple ways. Each construct defines a logic
    function and combining cells and their connections allow building more
    complex synthetic devices. As a proof of principle, we have implemented
    many logic functions by using just a few engineered cells. Of note, small
    modifications and combination of those cells allowed for implementing
    more complex circuits such as a multiplexer or a 1-bit adder with carry,
    showing the great potential for re-utilization of small parts of the
    circuit. Our results support the approach of using cellular consortia as
    an efficient way of engineering complex tasks not easily solvable using
    single-cell implementations.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The establishment of new species by hybridization is
    difficult because it requires the development of reproductive isolation
    (RI) in sympatry to escape the homogenizing effects of gene flow from the
    parental species. Here we investigated the role of two pre- and two
    postzygotic mechanisms of RI in a system comprising two interdependent
    Pogonomyrmex harvester ant lineages (the H1 and H2 lineages) of hybrid
    origin and one of their parental species (P. rugosus). Similar to most
    other ants, P. rugosus is characterized by an environmental system of
    caste determination with female brood developing either into queens or
    workers depending on nongenetic factors. By contrast, there is a strong
    genetic component to caste determination in the H1 and H2 lineages
    because the developmental fate of female brood depends on the genetic
    origin of the parents, with interlineage eggs developing into workers and
    intralineage eggs developing into queens. The study of a mixed mating
    aggregation revealed strong differences in mating flight timing between
    P. rugosus and the two lineages as a first mechanism of RI. A second
    important prezygotic mechanism was assortative mating. Laboratory
    experiments also provided support for one of the two investigated
    mechanisms of postzygotic isolation. The majority of offspring produced
    from the few matings between P. rugosus and the lineages aborted at the
    egg stage. This hybrid inviability was under maternal influence, with
    hybrids produced by P. rugosus queens being always inviable whereas a
    small proportion of H2 lineage queens produced large numbers of adult
    hybrid offspring. Finally, we found no evidence that genetic caste
    determination acted as a second postzygotic mechanism reducing gene flow
    between P. rugosus and the H lineages. The few viable P. rugosus-H
    hybrids were not preferentially shunted into functionally sterile workers
    but developed into both workers and queens. Overall, these results reveal
    that the nearly complete (99.5\\%) RI between P. rugosus and the two
    hybrid lineages stems from the combination of two typical prezygotic
    mechanisms (mating time divergence and assortative mating) and one
    postzygotic mechanism (hybrid inviability).>

    <bib-field|abstract|Treatment of spermatozoa with either the nonionic
    detergent Triton X-100 (TX) or dithiothreitol (DTT) has been suggested to
    confer enhanced success on intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in
    mice and humans. Here, we attempted to use both reagents together, to our
    knowledge for the first time, and found that this caused severe
    chromosomal breaks in paternal pronuclei. We documented this effect
    further by treating mouse spermatozoa with several combinations of DTT
    with and without detergent. Spermatozoa were treated with vigorous
    pipetting to induce membrane disruption or with TX or the ionic detergent
    mixed alkyltrimethylammonium bromide (ATAB). Swim-up spermatozoa were
    used as controls. In each treatment, two samples were tested, with or
    without the addition of DTT during the treatment procedure. In all
    samples with DTT, protamine reduction was confirmed by the decondensation
    assay. Sperm nuclei obtained after different treatments were injected
    into oocytes for cytogenetic analysis, and paternal and maternal
    chromosomes of the zygote were visualized and examined. We found that the
    numbers of normal paternal karyoplates resulting from ICSI with
    spermatozoa treated with either DTT (87\\%, 153/176), TX (79\\%,
    112/142), or ATAB (85\\%, 99/116) alone were similar to swim-up controls
    (92\\%, 103/112). However, only 22\\% (23/103) and 40\\% (59/149) of
    examined metaphases were scored as normal in TX + DTT or ATAB + DTT
    treatments, respectively. Spermatozoa in which the membranes were
    disrupted by vigorous pipetting in the presence of DTT had a slightly
    reduced frequency of normal chromosomes (61\\%, 64/104), whereas those
    without DTT were normal (79\\%, 125/159). However, this difference was
    not statistically significant. When spermatozoa were treated with TX +
    DTT in the presence of EGTA or a mixture of EGTA and EDTA, the frequency
    of normal chromosomes was 39\\% (45/114) and 47\\% (38/81), respectively,
    suggesting that endogenous sperm nucleases may play a role in chromosomal
    damage. Our results indicate that simultaneous treatment of spermatozoa
    with detergent and DTT induces extensive chromosomal breakage and,
    therefore, should not be attempted in ICSI.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Identifying the tissues in which a microRNA is
    expressed could enhance the understanding of the functions, the
    biological processes, and the diseases associated with that microRNA.
    However, the mechanisms of microRNA biogenesis and expression remain
    largely unclear and the identification of the tissues in which a microRNA
    is expressed is limited. Here, we present a machine learning based
    approach to predict whether an intronic microRNA show high co-expression
    with its host gene, by doing so, we could infer the tissues in which a
    microRNA is high expressed through the expression profile of its host
    gene. Our approach is able to achieve an accuracy of 79\\% in the
    leave-one-out cross validation and 95\\% on an independent testing
    dataset. We further estimated our method through comparing the predicted
    tissue specific microRNAs and the tissue specific microRNAs identified by
    biological experiments. This study presented a valuable tool to predict
    the co-expression patterns between human intronic microRNAs and their
    host genes, which would also help to understand the microRNA expression
    and regulation mechanisms. Finally, this framework can be easily extended
    to other species.>

    <bib-field|abstract|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of three
    potassium channels, voltage-dependent K⊕ channel (K(V)),
    calcium-activated K⊕ channel (K(Ca)) and ATP-sensitive K⊕ channel
    (K(ATP)), on the proliferation, apoptosis and related-gene expression in
    human bronchial smooth muscle cells (HBSMCs). METHODS: Normal human
    bronchial tissues were obtained from 5 patients undergoing lung partial
    resection for carcinomas. The cultured HBSMCs were divided into four
    groups: (1) control group; (2) 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) group: containing 4
    mmol/L 4-AP; (3) TEA group: containing 1 mmol/L TEA; (4) Glib group:
    containing 0.1 mmol/L Glib. The cell cycles were observed by
    flow-cytometry; Ca(2+) concentration in HBSMCs were investigated by
    fluorescent quantification using fluorospectrophotometer. The
    proliferation and apoptosis were detected by MTT methods and TUNEL,
    respectively. Immunocytochemical staining was used to detect the effects
    of three potassium channel blockers on the expressions of PCNA and
    apoptosis related-gene Fas, FasL of HBSMCs. RESULTS: (1) The K(V) blocker
    4-AP was shown to significantly increase the optical density value [the
    value of A of the 4-AP group was (0.67 +/- 0.14), compared to the control
    group (0.30 +/- 0.08), P\< 0.01] and the expression of proliferating cell
    nucleus antigen [the positive percentage of PCNA of the 4-AP group was
    (89 +/- 7)\\%, compared to the control group (23 +/- 5)]\\%, P \< 0.01).
    4-AP significantly increased the Ca(2+) concentration [(255 +/- 17)
    nmol/L] in cultured HBSMCs, compared to the control group [(98 +/- 7)
    nmol/L, P \< 0.01] and the numbers [(28.8 +/- 2.4)\\%] of S + G(2)M
    HBSMCs by flow-cytometry in cultured HBSMCs, compared to the control
    group [(12.6 +/- 4.8)\\%, P \< 0.01]. The value of A of TEA group and
    Glib group were all (0.30 +/- 0.07). The positive percentage of PCNA of
    the two groups were (21 +/- 5)\\%, (20 +/- 4)\\%, respectively. Ca(2+)
    concentration of the two groups were (97 +/- 7) nmol/L, (99 +/- 6)
    nmol/L, respectively. And the numbers of S + G(2)M HBSMCs were (12.8 +/-
    4.4)\\%, (11.0 +/- 4.4)\\%, respectively. But no significant differences
    were found between the two groups and the control group (all P \> 0.05).
    (2) The level of TUNEL and the expressions of Fas and FasL of the control
    were (4.36 +/- 0.66)\\%, (2.92 +/- 0.25)\\%, (4.0 +/- 0.6)\\%,
    respectively. 4-AP significantly decrease the apoptosis rate and the
    expressions of Fas, FasL [(0.84 +/- 0.13)\\%, (0.92 +/- 0.16)]\\%, (1.4
    +/- 0.6)\\%, respectively) (compared to control, all P \< 0.01). The
    level of TUNEL of TEA group and Glib group were (4.47 +/- 0.93)\\%, (4.33
    +/- 0.77)\\%, respectively. And the expressions of Fas, FasL of the two
    groups were (2.87 +/- 0.23)\\%, (4.2 +/- 0.8)\\%, (2.91 +/- 0.26)\\% and
    (4.2 +/- 0.9)\\%, respectively. There were no significant differences
    between the two groups and the control group (all P \> 0.05). CONCLUSION:
    Inhibition of K(V) activity can increase the proliferation and
    intracellular [Ca(2+)]i, and decrease the apoptosis of HBSMCs, but
    inhibition of K(Ca) and K(ATP) showed no effects.>

    <bib-field|abstract|A family of 5 genes that evolved within the past 1.9
    Myr in diploid wheat was characterized. The ancestral gene, ALP-A1, is on
    chromosome 1A and encodes an aci-reductone dioxygenase-like protein. The
    duplicated genes ALP-A2, ALP-A3, ALP-A4.1, and ALP-A4.2 acquired complete
    coding sequences but lost the original promoter. They are on chromosomes
    4A, 2A, 6A and 6A, respectively, and evolved sequentially, the youngest
    duplicated gene always producing the next duplicate. It is shown that
    dispersed gene duplication rate consists of the primary rate
    (duplications of ancestral genes) and the secondary rate (duplications of
    genes that had been generated by recent duplications). The primary rate
    was 2.5 x 10(-3) gene(-1) Myr(-1) in diploid wheat. The secondary rate
    was 5.2 x 10(-2) gene(-1) Myr(-1) in the ALP family. The 20-fold
    acceleration of the secondary rate was caused by the insertion of the
    ALP-A2 gene into a novel type transposon. Only the ALP-A1 and ALP-A3
    genes are transcribed. The transcription of ALP-A3 is directed by a
    promoter within a DNA fragment similar to a CACTA type of DNA
    transposons, making ALP-A3 a new gene. The ALP-A3 transcript is longer
    than that of the ALP-A1. The half-life of ALP duplicated genes was
    estimated to be 0.87 Myr. Strong purifying selection acting on the
    ancestral gene ALP-A1 was undiminished by the evolution of duplicated
    genes. The evolution of the ALP family shows that repeated elements
    facilitate both gene duplication and expression of duplicated genes and
    highlights their importance for the evolution of gene repertoire in large
    plant genomes.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Over the past five decades, a plethora of nonrandom
    chromosomal abnormalities have been consistently reported in malignant
    cells facilitating the identification of cancer-associated protein coding
    oncogenes and tumor suppressors. The genetic dissection of hot spots for
    chromosomal abnormalities in the age of the sequenced human genome
    resulted in the discovery that microRNA (miRNA) genes, encoding for a
    class of small noncoding RNAs, frequently resides in such genomic
    regions. The combination of nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities and other
    types of genetic alterations or epigenetic events contribute to
    downregulation or overexpression of miRNAs. The consequent abnormal
    expression of miRNAs affect cell cycle, survival and differentiation
    programs and selective targeting of these noncoding genes could provide
    novel therapeutic options for killing the malignant cells.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Spermatozoa are a focal point for the impact of
    sexual selection due to sperm competition and sperm-female interactions
    in a wide range of sexually reproducing organisms. In depth molecular
    investigation of the ramifications of these selective regimes have been
    limited due to a lack of information concerning the molecular composition
    of sperm. In this study, we utilize three previously published proteomic
    datasets in conjunction with our whole mouse sperm proteomic analysis to
    delineate cellular regions of sperm most impacted by positive selection.
    Interspecific analysis reveals robust evolutionary acceleration of sperm
    cell membrane genes (which include genes encoding acrosomal and sperm
    cell surface proteins) relative to other sperm genes, and evidence for
    positive selection in approximately 22\\% of sperm cell membrane
    components was obtained using maximum likelihood models. The selective
    forces driving the accelerated evolution of these membrane proteins may
    occur at a number of locations during sperm development, maturation and
    transit through the female reproductive tract where the sperm cell
    membrane and eventually the acrosome are exposed to the extracellular
    milieu and available for direct cell-cell interactions.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Cancer is widely perceived as a heterogeneous group
    of disorders with markedly different biological properties, which are
    caused by a series of clonally selected genetic changes in key
    tumour-suppressor genes and oncogenes. However, recent data suggest that
    cancer has a fundamentally common basis that is grounded in a polyclonal
    epigenetic disruption of stem/progenitor cells, mediated by
    'tumour-progenitor genes'. Furthermore, tumour cell heterogeneity is due
    in part to epigenetic variation in progenitor cells, and epigenetic
    plasticity together with genetic lesions drives tumour progression. This
    crucial early role for epigenetic alterations in cancer is in addition to
    epigenetic alterations that can substitute for genetic variation later in
    tumour progression. Therefore, non-neoplastic but epigenetically
    disrupted stem/progenitor cells might be a crucial target for cancer risk
    assessment and chemoprevention.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The rodent family Muridae is the single most diverse
    family of mammals with over 1300 recognized species. We used DNA
    sequences from the first exon ( approximately 1200bp) of the IRBP gene to
    infer phylogenetic relationships within and among the major lineages of
    muroid rodents. We included sequences from every recognized muroid
    subfamily except Platacanthomyinae and from all genera within the endemic
    Malagasy subfamily Nesomyinae, all recognized tribes of Sigmodontinae,
    and a broad sample of genera in Murinae. Phylogenetic analysis of the
    IRBP data suggest that muroid rodents can be sorted into five major
    lineages: (1) a basal clade containing the fossorial rodents in the
    subfamilies Spalacinae, Myospalacinae, and Rhizomyinae, (2) a clade of
    African and Malagasy genera comprising the subfamilies Petromyscinae,
    Mystromyinae, Cricetomyinae, Nesomyinae, and core dendromurines, (3) a
    clade of Old World taxa belonging to Murinae, Otomyinae, Gerbillinae,
    Acomyinae, and Lophiomyinae, (4) a clade uniting the subfamilies
    Sigmodontinae, Arvicolinae, and Cricetinae, and (5) a unique lineage
    containing the monotypic Calomyscinae. Although relationships among the
    latter four clades cannot be resolved, several well-supported
    supergeneric groupings within each are identified. A preliminary
    examination of molar tooth morphology on the resulting phylogeny suggests
    the triserial murid molar pattern as conceived by evolved at least three
    times during the course of muroid evolution.>

    <bib-field|abstract|miRNAs (microRNAs) are a class of endogenous small
    RNAs that are thought to negatively regulate protein production. Aberrant
    expression of many miRNAs is linked to cancer and other diseases. Little
    is known about the factors that regulate the expression of miRNAs. We
    have identified numerous regulatory elements upstream of miRNA genes that
    are likely to be essential to the transcriptional and posttranscriptional
    regulation of miRNAs. Newly identified regulatory motifs occur frequently
    and in multiple copies upstream of miRNAs. The motifs are highly enriched
    in G and C nucleotides, in comparison with the nucleotide composition of
    miRNA upstream sequences. Although the motifs were predicted using
    sequences that are upstream of miRNAs, we find that 99\\% of the
    top-predicted motifs preferentially occur within the first 500
    nucleotides upstream of the transcription start sites of protein-coding
    genes; the observed preference in location underscores the validity and
    importance of the motifs identified in this study. Our study also raises
    the possibility that a considerable number of well-characterized,
    disease-associated transcription factors (TFs) of protein-coding genes
    contribute to the abnormal miRNA expression in diseases such as cancer.
    Further analysis of predicted miRNA-protein interactions lead us to
    hypothesize that TFs that include c-Myb, NF-Y, Sp-1, MTF-1, and AP-2alpha
    are master-regulators of miRNA expression. Our predictions are a solid
    starting point for the systematic elucidation of the causative basis for
    aberrant expression patterns of disease-related (e.g., cancer) miRNAs.
    Thus, we point out that focused studies of the TFs that regulate miRNAs
    will be paramount in developing cures for miRNA-related diseases. The
    identification of the miRNA regulatory motifs was facilitated by a new
    computational method, K-Factor. K-Factor predicts regulatory motifs in a
    set of functionally related sequences, without relying on evolutionary
    conservation.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Protamines are small, highly basic DNA-binding
    proteins found in the sperm of animals. Interestingly, the proportion of
    arginine residues in one type of protamine, protamine P1, is about 50\\%
    in mammals. Upon closer examination, it was found that both the total
    number of amino acids and the positions of arginine residues have changed
    considerably during the course of mammalian evolution. This evolutionary
    pattern suggests that protamine P1 is under an unusual form of purifying
    selection, in which the high proportion of arginine residues is
    maintained but the positions may vary. In this case, we would expect that
    the rate of nonsynonymous substitution is not particularly low compared
    with that of synonymous substitution, despite purifying selection. We
    would also expect that the selection for a high arginine content results
    in a high frequency of the nucleotide G in the coding region of this
    gene, because all six arginine codons contain at least one G. These
    expectations were confirmed in our study of mammalian protamine genes.
    Analysis of nonmammalian vertebrate genes also showed essentially the
    same patterns of evolutionary changes, suggesting that this unusual form
    of purifying selection has been active since the origin of bony
    vertebrates. The protamine gene of an insect species shows similar
    patterns, although its purifying selection is less intense. These
    observations suggest that arginine-rich selection is a general feature of
    protamine evolution. The driving force for arginine-rich selection
    appears to be the DNA-binding function of protamine P1 and an interaction
    with a protein kinase in the fertilized egg.>

    <bib-field|abstract|PAML, currently in version 4, is a package of
    programs for phylogenetic analyses of DNA and protein sequences using
    maximum likelihood (ML). The programs may be used to compare and test
    phylogenetic trees, but their main strengths lie in the rich repertoire
    of evolutionary models implemented, which can be used to estimate
    parameters in models of sequence evolution and to test interesting
    biological hypotheses. Uses of the programs include estimation of
    synonymous and nonsynonymous rates (d(N) and d(S)) between two
    protein-coding DNA sequences, inference of positive Darwinian selection
    through phylogenetic comparison of protein-coding genes, reconstruction
    of ancestral genes and proteins for molecular restoration studies of
    extinct life forms, combined analysis of heterogeneous data sets from
    multiple gene loci, and estimation of species divergence times
    incorporating uncertainties in fossil calibrations. This note discusses
    some of the major applications of the package, which includes example
    data sets to demonstrate their use. The package is written in ANSI C, and
    runs under Windows, Mac OSX, and UNIX systems. It is available at --
    (http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html).>

    <bib-field|abstract|To compare entire genomes from different species,
    biologists increasingly need alignment methods that are efficient enough
    to handle long sequences, and accurate enough to correctly align the
    conserved biological features between distant species. We present LAGAN,
    a system for rapid global alignment of two homologous genomic sequences,
    and Multi-LAGAN, a system for multiple global alignment of genomic
    sequences. We tested our systems on a data set consisting of greater than
    12 Mb of high-quality sequence from 12 vertebrate species. All the
    sequence was derived from the genomic region orthologous to an
    approximately 1.5-Mb region on human chromosome 7q31.3. We found that
    both LAGAN and Multi-LAGAN compare favorably with other leading alignment
    methods in correctly aligning protein-coding exons, especially between
    distant homologs such as human and chicken, or human and fugu.
    Multi-LAGAN produced the most accurate alignments, while requiring just
    75 minutes on a personal computer to obtain the multiple alignment of all
    12 sequences. Multi-LAGAN is a practical method for generating multiple
    alignments of long genomic sequences at any evolutionary distance. Our
    systems are publicly available at http://lagan.stanford.edu.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The neutral model of biodiversity, proposed by
    Hubbell (The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography,
    Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 2001) to explain the diversity
    of functionally equivalent species, has been subject of hot debate in
    community ecology. Whereas Hubbell studied the model mostly by
    simulations, recently analytical treatments have yielded expressions of
    the expected number of species of a particular abundance in a local
    community with dispersal limitation. Moreover, a formula has been offered
    for the joint likelihood of observing a given species-abundance dataset
    in a local community with dispersal limitation, but this formula is too
    complicated to allow practical applications. Here, I present a much
    simplified expression that can be regarded as an enhanced version of the
    famous Ewens sampling formula. It can be used in maximum likelihood
    methods for quick estimation of the model parameters, using all
    information in the data, and for model comparison. I also show how to
    rapidly generate examples of species-abundance distributions for a given
    set of model parameters and how to calculate Simpson's diversity index.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Comparative analysis of multiple genomes in a
    phylogenetic framework dramatically improves the precision and
    sensitivity of evolutionary inference, producing more robust results than
    single-genome analyses can provide. The genomes of 12 Drosophila species,
    ten of which are presented here for the first time (sechellia, simulans,
    yakuba, erecta, ananassae, persimilis, willistoni, mojavensis, virilis
    and grimshawi), illustrate how rates and patterns of sequence divergence
    across taxa can illuminate evolutionary processes on a genomic scale.
    These genome sequences augment the formidable genetic tools that have
    made Drosophila melanogaster a pre-eminent model for animal genetics, and
    will further catalyse fundamental research on mechanisms of development,
    cell biology, genetics, disease, neurobiology, behaviour, physiology and
    evolution. Despite remarkable similarities among these Drosophila
    species, we identified many putatively non-neutral changes in
    protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA genes, and cis-regulatory regions.
    These may prove to underlie differences in the ecology and behaviour of
    these diverse species.>

    <bib-field|abstract|An increasing number of evidences show that genes are
    not distributed randomly across eukaryotic chromosomes, but rather in
    functional neighborhoods. Nevertheless, the driving force that originated
    and maintains such neighborhoods is still a matter of controversy. We
    present the first detailed multispecies cartography of genome regions
    enriched in genes with related functions and study the evolutionary
    implications of such clustering. Our results indicate that the
    chromosomes of higher eukaryotic genomes contain up to 12\\% of genes
    arranged in functional neighborhoods, with a high level of gene
    co-expression, which are consistently distributed in phylogenies.
    Unexpectedly, neighborhoods with homologous functions are formed by
    different (non-orthologous) genes in different species. Actually, instead
    of being conserved, functional neighborhoods present a higher degree of
    synteny breaks than the genome average. This scenario is compatible with
    the existence of selective pressures optimizing the coordinated
    transcription of blocks of functionally related genes. If these
    neighborhoods were broken by chromosomal rearrangements, selection would
    favor further rearrangements reconstructing other neighborhoods of
    similar function. The picture arising from this study is a dynamic
    genomic landscape with a high level of functional organization.>

    <bib-field|abstract|We present Babelomics, a complete suite of web tools
    for the functional analysis of groups of genes in high-throughput
    experiments, which includes the use of information on Gene Ontology
    terms, interpro motifs, KEGG pathways, Swiss-Prot keywords, analysis of
    predicted transcription factor binding sites, chromosomal positions and
    presence in tissues with determined histological characteristics, through
    five integrated modules: FatiGO (fast assignment and transference of
    information), FatiWise, transcription factor association test, GenomeGO
    and tissues mining tool, respectively. Additionally, another module,
    FatiScan, provides a new procedure that integrates biological information
    in combination with experimental results in order to find groups of genes
    with modest but coordinate significant differential behaviour. FatiScan
    is highly sensitive and is capable of finding significant asymmetries in
    the distribution of genes of common function across a list of ordered
    genes even if these asymmetries were not extreme. The strong
    multiple-testing nature of the contrasts made by the tools is taken into
    account. All the tools are integrated in the gene expression analysis
    package GEPAS. Babelomics is the natural evolution of our tool FatiGO
    (which analysed almost 22,000 experiments during the last year) to
    include more sources on information and new modes of using it. Babelomics

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: The higher-level phylogeny of placental
    mammals has long been a phylogenetic Gordian knot, with disagreement
    about both the precise contents of, and relationships between, the extant
    orders. A recent MRP supertree that favoured 'outdated' hypotheses
    (notably, monophyly of both Artiodactyla and Lipotyphla) has been heavily
    criticised for including low-quality and redundant data. We apply a
    stringent data selection protocol designed to minimise these problems to
    a much-expanded data set of morphological, molecular and combined source
    trees, to produce a supertree that includes every family of extant
    placental mammals. RESULTS: The supertree is well-resolved and supports
    both polyphyly of Lipotyphla and paraphyly of Artiodactyla with respect
    to Cetacea. The existence of four 'superorders'--Afrotheria, Xenarthra,
    Laurasiatheria and Euarchontoglires--is also supported. The topology is
    highly congruent with recent (molecular) phylogenetic analyses of
    placental mammals, but is considerably more comprehensive, being the
    first phylogeny to include all 113 extant families without making a
    priori assumptions of suprafamilial monophyly. Subsidiary analyses reveal
    that the data selection protocol played a key role in the major changes
    relative to a previously published higher-level supertree of placentals.
    CONCLUSION: The supertree should provide a useful framework for
    hypothesis testing in phylogenetic comparative biology, and supports the
    idea that biogeography has played a crucial role in the evolution of
    placental mammals. Our results demonstrate the importance of minimising
    poor and redundant data when constructing supertrees.>

    <bib-field|abstract|A large number of tiny noncoding RNAs have been
    cloned and named microRNAs (miRs). Recently, we have reported that
    miR-15a and miR-16a, located at 13q14, are frequently deleted and/or
    down-regulated in patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a
    disorder characterized by increased survival. To further investigate the
    possible involvement of miRs in human cancers on a genome-wide basis, we
    have mapped 186 miRs and compared their location to the location of
    previous reported nonrandom genetic alterations. Here, we show that miR
    genes are frequently located at fragile sites, as well as in minimal
    regions of loss of heterozygosity, minimal regions of amplification
    (minimal amplicons), or common breakpoint regions. Overall, 98 of 186
    (52.5\\%) of miR genes are in cancer-associated genomic regions or in
    fragile sites. Moreover, by Northern blotting, we have shown that several
    miRs located in deleted regions have low levels of expression in cancer
    samples. These data provide a catalog of miR genes that may have roles in
    cancer and argue that the full complement of miRs in a genome may be
    extensively involved in cancers.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common
    neurodegenerative disorder and is characterized by the loss of
    dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Mutations in PINK1 were
    shown to cause recessive familial PD, and today are proposed to be
    associated with the disease via mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative
    damage. The PINK1 gene comprises eight exons, which encode a ubiquitously
    expressed 581 amino acid protein that contains an N-terminal
    mitochondrial targeting domain and a serine/threonine protein kinase. To
    better understand the relationship between PINK1 and PD we have first
    analyzed the evolutionary history of the gene showing its late emergence
    in evolution. In addition, we have modeled the three-dimensional
    structure of PINK1 and found some evidences that help to explain the
    effect of some PD-related mutations in this protein's function.>

    <bib-field|abstract|During the elongating spermatid stage of
    spermiogenesis, human sperm chromatin undergoes a complex transition in
    which histones are extensively replaced by protamines in a carefully
    regulated transition including histone modifications and intermediate and
    temporary replacement of the histones by sperm-specific transition
    proteins. The replacement of most histones by protamines 1 and 2
    facilitates a high order of chromatin packaging necessary for normal
    sperm function and may also be necessary for DNA silencing and imprinting
    changes within the sperm cell. Protamines 1 and 2 are usually expressed
    in nearly equal quantities, but elevated or diminished protamine
    1/protamine 2 ratios are observed in some infertile men and is often
    associated with severe spermatogenesis defects. Human and animal studies
    demonstrate that expression of the protamine proteins is uniquely
    regulated by transcription/translation factors, including storage of the
    mRNA in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles composed of the mRNA,
    transcription factors and a kinesin molecule necessary for transport of
    the RNP to the cytoplasm and removal of transcriptional activators from
    the nucleus. Recent studies indicate that most patients with abnormal
    protamine protein levels have elevated levels of protamine transcript in
    the mature sperm cell, indicating a possible defect in transcription or
    translation. The regulation of protamine expression is unique and
    includes several possible mechanisms which may be responsible for
    dysregulation of protamine expression and concurrent broad spectrum
    defects in spermatogenesis. We suggest two hypotheses: (i) that abnormal
    protamine expression is indicative of a generalized defect in mRNA
    storage and/or translation which affects other mRNA transcripts or (ii)
    that protamines may act as a checkpoint of spermatogenesis.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Changes in the patterns of gene expression are widely
    believed to underlie many of the phenotypic differences within and
    between species. Although much emphasis has been placed on changes in
    transcriptional regulation, gene expression is regulated at many levels,
    all of which must ultimately be studied together to obtain a complete
    picture of the evolution of gene expression. Here we compare the
    evolution of transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional
    regulation that is mediated by microRNAs, a large class of small,
    non-coding RNAs in plants and animals, focusing on the evolution of the
    individual regulators and their binding sites. As an initial step towards
    integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, we propose a
    simple model that describes the transcriptional regulation of new

    <bib-field|abstract|Across diverse taxa, seminal fluid proteins (Sfps)
    transferred at mating affect the reproductive success of both sexes. Such
    reproductive proteins often evolve under positive selection between
    species; because of this rapid divergence, Sfps are hypothesized to play
    a role in speciation by contributing to reproductive isolation between
    populations. In Drosophila, individual Sfps have been characterized and
    are known to alter male sperm competitive ability and female post-mating
    behavior, but a proteomic-scale view of the transferred Sfps has been
    missing. Here we describe a novel proteomic method that uses
    whole-organism isotopic labeling to detect transferred Sfps in mated
    female D. melanogaster. We identified 63 proteins, which were previously
    unknown to function in reproduction, and confirmed the transfer of dozens
    of predicted Sfps. Relative quantification of protein abundance revealed
    that several of these novel Sfps are abundant in seminal fluid. Positive
    selection and tandem gene duplication are the prevailing forces of Sfp
    evolution, and comparative proteomics with additional species revealed
    lineage-specific changes in seminal fluid content. We also report a
    proteomic-based gene discovery method that uncovered 19 previously
    unannotated genes in D. melanogaster. Our results demonstrate an
    experimental method to identify transferred proteins in any system that
    is amenable to isotopic labeling, and they underscore the power of
    combining proteomic and evolutionary analyses to shed light on the
    complex process of Drosophila reproduction.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The growing availability of complete genomic
    sequences from diverse species has brought about the need to scale up
    phylogenomic analyses, including the reconstruction of large collections
    of phylogenetic trees. Here, we present the third version of PhylomeDB
    (http://phylomeDB.org), a public database for genome-wide collections of
    gene phylogenies (phylomes). Currently, PhylomeDB is the largest
    phylogenetic repository and hosts 17 phylomes, comprising 416,093 trees
    and 165,840 alignments. It is also a major source for phylogeny-based
    orthology and paralogy predictions, covering about 5 million proteins in
    717 fully-sequenced genomes. For each protein-coding gene in a seed
    genome, the database provides original and processed alignments,
    phylogenetic trees derived from various methods and phylogeny-based
    predictions of orthology and paralogy relationships. The new version of
    phylomeDB has been extended with novel data access and visualization
    features, including the possibility of programmatic access. Available
    seed species include model organisms such as human, yeast, Escherichia
    coli or Arabidopsis thaliana, but also alternative model species such as
    the human pathogen Candida albicans, or the pea aphid Acyrtosiphon pisum.
    Finally, PhylomeDB is currently being used by several genome sequencing
    projects that couple the genome annotation process with the
    reconstruction of the corresponding phylome, a strategy that provides
    relevant evolutionary insights.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The extent to which natural selection shapes
    phenotypic variation has long been a matter of debate among those
    studying organic evolution. We studied the patterns of gene expression
    polymorphism and divergence in several datasets that ranged from
    comparisons between two very closely related laboratory strains of mice
    to comparisons across a considerably longer time scale, such as between
    humans and chimpanzees, two species of mice, and two species of
    Drosophila. The results were analyzed and interpreted in view of neutral
    models of phenotypic evolution. Our analyses used a number of metrics to
    show that most mRNA levels are evolutionary stable, changing little
    across the range of taxonomic distances compared. This implies that,
    overall, widespread stabilizing selection on transcription levels has
    prevented greater evolutionary changes in mRNA levels. Nevertheless, the
    range of rates of divergence is large with highly significant differences
    in the rate and patterns of transcription divergence across functional
    classes defined on the basis of the gene ontology annotation (primates
    and mice datasets) or on the basis of the pattern of sex-biased gene
    expression (Drosophila). Moreover, rates of divergence of sex-biased
    genes in the contrast between Drosophila species show a distinct pattern
    from that observed in the contrast between populations of D.
    melanogaster. Hence, we discuss the time scale of the changes observed
    and its consequences for the relationship between variation in gene
    expression within and between species. Finally, we argue that differences
    in mRNA levels of the magnitudes observed herein could be explained by a
    remarkably small number of generations of directional selection.>

    <bib-field|abstract|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that
    repress protein synthesis by binding to target messenger RNAs. We
    investigated the effect of target secondary structure on the efficacy of
    repression by miRNAs. Using structures predicted by the Sfold program, we
    model the interaction between an miRNA and a target as a two-step
    hybridization reaction: nucleation at an accessible target site followed
    by hybrid elongation to disrupt local target secondary structure and form
    the complete miRNA-target duplex. This model accurately accounts for the
    sensitivity to repression by let-7 of various mutant forms of the
    Caenorhabditis elegans lin-41 3' untranslated region and for other
    experimentally tested miRNA-target interactions in C. elegans and
    Drosophila melanogaster. These findings indicate a potent effect of
    target structure on target recognition by miRNAs and establish a
    structure-based framework for genome-wide identification of animal miRNA

    <bib-field|abstract|Phenotypic adaptations may be the result of changes
    in gene structure or gene regulation, but little is known about the
    evolution of gene expression. In addition, it is unclear whether the same
    selective forces may operate at both levels simultaneously. Reproductive
    proteins evolve rapidly, but the underlying selective forces promoting
    such rapid changes are still a matter of debate. In particular, the role
    of sexual selection in driving positive selection among reproductive
    proteins remains controversial, whereas its potential influence on
    changes in promoter regions has not been explored. Protamines are
    responsible for maintaining DNA in a compacted form in chromosomes in
    sperm and the available evidence suggests that they evolve rapidly.
    Because protamines condense DNA within the sperm nucleus, they influence
    sperm head shape. Here, we examine the influence of sperm competition
    upon protamine 1 and protamine 2 genes and their promoters, by comparing
    closely related species of Mus that differ in relative testes size, a
    reliable indicator of levels of sperm competition. We find evidence of
    positive selection in the protamine 2 gene in the species with the
    highest inferred levels of sperm competition. In addition, sperm
    competition levels across all species are strongly associated with high
    divergence in protamine 2 promoters that, in turn, are associated with
    sperm swimming speed. We suggest that changes in protamine 2 promoters
    are likely to enhance sperm swimming speed by making sperm heads more
    hydrodynamic. Such phenotypic changes are adaptive because sperm swimming
    speed may be a major determinant of fertilization success under sperm
    competition. Thus, when species have diverged recently, few changes in
    gene-coding sequences are found, while high divergence in promoters seems
    to be associated with the intensity of sexual selection.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The protamine gene cluster containing the Prm1, Prm2,
    Prm3, and Tnp2 genes is present in humans, mice, and rats. The Prm1,
    Prm2, and Tnp2 genes have been extensively studied, but almost nothing is
    known about the function and regulation of the Prm3 gene. Here we
    demonstrate that an intronless Prm3 gene encoding a distinctive small
    acidic protein is present in 13 species from seven orders of mammals. We
    also demonstrate that the Prm3 gene has not generated retroposons, which
    supports the contention that genes that are expressed in meiotic and
    haploid spermatogenic cells do not generate retroposons. The Prm3 mRNA is
    first detected in early round spermatids, while the PRM3 protein is first
    detected in late spermatids. Thus, translation of the Prm3 mRNA is
    developmentally delayed similar to the Prm1, Prm2, and Tnp2 mRNAs. In
    contrast to PRM1, PRM2, and TNP2, PRM3 is an acidic protein that is
    localized in the cytoplasm of elongated spermatids and transfected
    NIH-3T3 cells. To elucidate the function of PRM3, the Prm3 gene was
    disrupted by homologous recombination. Sperm from Prm3(-/-) males
    exhibited reductions in motility, but the fertility of Prm3(-/-) and
    Prm3(+/+) males was similar in matings of one male and one female. We
    have developed a competition test in which a mutant male has to compete
    with a rival wild-type male to fertilize a female; the implications of
    these results are also discussed.>

    <bib-field|abstract|In mammalian genomes, linked genes show similar rates
    of evolution, both at fourfold degenerate synonymous sites (K4) and at
    nonsynonymous sites (KA). Although it has been suggested that the local
    similarity in the synonymous substitution rate is an artifact caused by
    the inclusion of disparately evolving gene pairs, we demonstrate here
    that this is not the case: after removal of disparately evolving genes,
    both (1) linked genes and (2) introns from the same gene have more
    similar silent substitution rates than expected by chance. What causes
    the local similarity in both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution
    rates? One class of hypotheses argues that both may be related to the
    observed clustering of genes of comparable expression profile. We
    investigate these hypotheses using substitution rates from both
    human-mouse and mouse-rat comparisons, and employing three different
    methods to assay expression parameters. Although we confirm a negative
    correlation of expression breadth with both K4 and KA, we find no
    evidence that clustering of similarly expressed genes explains the
    clustering of genes of comparable substitution rates. If gene expression
    is not responsible, what about other causes? At least in the human-mouse
    comparison, the local similarity in KA can be explained by the
    covariation of KA and K4. As regards K4, our results appear consistent
    with the notion that local similarity is due to processes associated with
    meiotic recombination.>

    <bib-field|abstract|PROTEINS often differ in amino-acid sequence across
    species. This difference has evolved by the accumulation of neutral
    mutations by random drift, the fixation of adaptive mutations by
    selection, or a mixture of the two. Here we propose a simple statistical
    test of the neutral protein evolution hypothesis based on a comparison of
    the number of amino-acid replacement substitutions to synonymous
    substitutions in the coding region of a locus. If the observed
    substitutions are neutral, the ratio of replacement to synonymous fixed
    differences between species should be the same as the ratio of
    replacement to synonymous polymorphisms within species. DNA sequence data
    on the Adh locus (encoding alcohol dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.1) in three
    species in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup do not fit this
    expectation; instead, there are more fixed replacement differences
    between species than expected. We suggest that these excess replacement
    substitutions result from adaptive fixation of selectively advantageous
    mutations.>

    <bib-field|abstract|To investigate the origin and evolution of essential
    genes, we identified and phenotyped 195 young protein-coding genes, which
    originated 3 to 35 million years ago in Drosophila. Knocking down
    expression with RNA interference showed that 30\\% of newly arisen genes
    are essential for viability. The proportion of genes that are essential
    is similar in every evolutionary age group that we examined. Under
    constitutive silencing of these young essential genes, lethality was high
    in the pupal stage and also found in the larval stages. Lethality was
    attributed to diverse cellular and developmental defects, such as organ
    formation and patterning defects. These data suggest that new genes

    <bib-field|abstract|In eukaryotes, neighboring genes can be packaged
    together in specific chromatin structures that ensure their coordinated
    expression. Examples of such multi-gene chromatin domains are
    well-documented, but a global view of the chromatin organization of
    eukaryotic genomes is lacking. To systematically identify multi-gene
    chromatin domains, we constructed a compendium of genome-scale binding
    maps for a broad panel of chromatin-associated proteins in Drosophila
    melanogaster. Next, we computationally analyzed this compendium for
    evidence of multi-gene chromatin domains using a novel statistical
    segmentation algorithm. We find that at least 50\\% of all fly genes are
    organized into chromatin domains, which often consist of dozens of genes.
    The domains are characterized by various known and novel combinations of
    chromatin proteins. The genes in many of the domains are coregulated
    during development and tend to have similar biological functions.
    Furthermore, during evolution fewer chromosomal rearrangements occur
    inside chromatin domains than outside domains. Our results indicate that
    a substantial portion of the Drosophila genome is packaged into
    functionally coherent, multi-gene chromatin domains. This has broad
    mechanistic implications for gene regulation and genome evolution.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Missense variants are commonly identified in genomic
    sequence but only a small fraction directly contribute to oncogenesis.
    The ability to distinguish those missense changes that contribute to
    cancer progression from those that do not is a difficult problem usually
    only accomplished through functional in vivo analyses. Using two
    computational algorithms, Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) and the
    Pfam-based LogR.E-value method, we have identified features that
    distinguish cancer-associated missense mutations from other classes of
    missense change. Our data reveal that cancer mutants behave similarly to
    Mendelian disease mutations, but are clearly distinct from either complex
    disease mutations or common single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We show that
    both activating and inactivating oncogenic mutations are predicted to be
    deleterious, although activating changes are likely to increase protein
    activity. Using the Gene Ontology and data from the SIFT and LogR.E-value
    metrics, a classifier was built that predicts cancer-associated missense
    mutations with a very low false-positive rate. The classifier does
    remarkably well in a number of different experiments designed to
    distinguish polymorphisms from true cancer-associated mutations. We also
    show that recurrently observed mutations are much more likely to be
    predicted to be cancer-associated than rare mutations, suggesting that
    our classifier will be useful in distinguishing causal from passenger
    mutations. In addition, from an expressed sequence tag–based screen, we
    identified a previously unknown germ line change (P1104A) in tumor
    tissues that is predicted to disrupt the function of the TYK2 protein.
    The data presented here show that this novel bioinformatics approach to
    classifying cancer-associated variants is robust and can be used for
    large-scale analyses. [Cancer Res 2007;67(2):465–73]>

    <bib-field|abstract|The neutral theory of S. P. Hubbell postulates a
    two-scale hierarchical framework consisting of a metacommunity following
    the speciation-drift equilibrium characterized by the "biodiversity
    number" theta, and local communities following the migration-drift
    equilibrium characterized by the "migration rate" m (or the "fundamental
    dispersal number" I). While Etienne's sampling formula allows
    simultaneous estimation of theta and m from a single sample of a local
    community, its applicability to a network of (rather small) samples is
    questionable. We define here an alternative two-stage approach estimating
    theta from an adequate subset of the individuals sampled in the field
    (using Ewens' sampling formula) and m from community samples (using
    Etienne's sampling formula). We compare its results with the simultaneous
    estimation of theta and m (one-stage estimation), for simulated neutral
    samples and for 50 1-ha plots of evergreen forest in South India. The
    one-stage approach exhibits problems of bias and of poor
    differentiability between high-theta, low-m and low-theta, high-m
    solution domains. Conversely, the two-stage approach yielded reasonable
    estimates and is to be preferred when several small, scattered plots are
    available instead of a single large one.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Despite only becoming popular at the beginning of
    this decade, biomolecular networks are now frameworks that facilitate
    many discoveries in molecular biology. The nodes of these networks are
    usually proteins (specifically enzymes in metabolic networks), whereas
    the links (or edges) are their interactions with other molecules. These
    networks are made up of protein-protein interactions or enzyme-enzyme
    interactions through shared metabolites in the case of metabolic
    networks. Evolutionary analysis has revealed that changes in the nodes
    and links in protein-protein interaction and metabolic networks are
    subject to different selection pressures owing to distinct topological
    features. However, many evolutionary constraints can be uncovered only if

    <bib-field|abstract|The adaptive significance of enzyme variation has
    been of central interest in population genetics. Yet, how natural
    selection operates on enzymes in the larger context of biochemical
    pathways has not been broadly explored. A basic expectation is that
    natural selection on metabolic phenotypes will target enzymes that
    control metabolic flux, but how adaptive variation is distributed among
    enzymes in metabolic networks is poorly understood. Here, we use
    population genetic methods to identify enzymes responding to adaptive
    selection in the pathways of central metabolism in Drosophila
    melanogaster and Drosophila simulans. We report polymorphism and
    divergence data for 17 genes that encode enzymes of 5 metabolic pathways
    that converge at glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Deviations from neutral
    expectations were observed at five loci. Of the 10 genes that encode the
    enzymes of glycolysis, only aldolase (Ald) deviated from neutrality. The
    other 4 genes that were inconsistent with neutral evolution
    (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6pd]), phosphoglucomutase [Pgm],
    trehalose-6-phosphate synthetase [Tps1], and glucose-6phosphatase
    [G6pase] encode G6P branch point enzymes that catalyze reactions at the
    entry point to the pentose-phosphate, glycogenic, trehalose synthesis,
    and gluconeogenic pathways. We reconcile these results with population
    genetics theory and existing arguments on metabolic regulation and
    propose that the incidence of adaptive selection in this system is
    related to the distribution of flux control. The data suggest that
    adaptive evolution of G6P branch point enzymes may have special
    significance in metabolic adaptation.>

    of silent (synonymous) and amino acid-altering (nonsynonymous) nucleotide
    substitutions when the underlying mutation rates among the four kinds of
    nucleotides are not equal. It is assumed that the substitution rates are
    constant over evolutionary time, the codon frequencies being in
    equilibrium, and, thus, the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous
    substitutions both increase linearly with evolutionary time. It is shown
    that, when the mutation rates are not equal, the estimate of synonymous
    substitutions obtained by F. Perler, A. Efstratiadis, P. Lomedico, W.
    Gilbert, R. Kolodner and J. Dodgson's "Percent Corrected Divergence"
    method increases nonlinearly, although the true number of synonymous
    substitutions increases linearly. It is, therefore, possible that the
    "saturation" of synonymous substitutions observed by Perler et al. is due
    to the inefficiency of their method to detect all synonymous
    substitutions.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Adaptive systems are those biological and
    non-biological assemblages able to evolve by natural selection. They are
    formed by entities with the property to replicate with errors in such a
    way that these variants bias directly, or indirectly, their own frequency
    in later generations. Neo-Darwinism focused on the study of a single
    adaptive system, i.e.: populations of multicellular organisms with sexual
    reproduction and early somatic and germ line differentiation1.
    Evolutionary biologists however recognize that entities like genes,
    chromosomes, cells, organisms, kin, animal societies, cultural characters
    and computer programs are indeed able to evolve by differential
    reproductive success of heritable variants. The objective of this paper
    is to overview the main ideas and con- cepts dealing with the origin and
    evolution of individuality at different hierarchical lev- els of
    biological organization2. First, I’ll describe the evolutionary
    dynamics in three abstract spaces. This will led us to distinguish
    replicator versus interactor concepts and codical versus material
    domains. This will allow us too to introduce the problem of the units of
    selection and the concept of organism from an evolutionary perspective.
    After, I’ll follow sketch the major transitions in evolution, many of
    them originate the compo- nents of alternative adaptive systems.
    Cooperation and conflicts were recurrent proc- esses guiding the
    construction of alliances between units of selection. Cooperation by kin
    selection, trait- group selection, reciprocal altruism and byproduct
    mutualism will be differentiated, at the same time fraternal and
    egalitarian alliances will be distin- guished. Exceptions to cooperation
    and mechanisms to avoid selfish interest of free rid- ers are also
    discussed. I’ll conclude with an outline of the alternative ways by
    which he- reditary information was stored and transmitted during the
    course of biological evolu- tion from one generation to the next.>

    <bib-field|abstract|From Darwin onward, it has been second nature for
    evolutionary biologists to think comparatively, because comparisons
    establish the generality of evolutionary phenomena. Do large genomes slow
    down development? What lifestyles select for large brains? Are extinction
    rates related to body size? These are all questions for the comparative
    method, and this book is about how such questions can be answered. It
    examines how the comparative method complements other approaches,
    identifies the biological causes of similarity among species, and
    discusses methods for reconstructing phylogenetic trees, along with many
    other topics. The book will interest all students, professionals, and
    researchers in evolutionary biology, ecology, genetics and related
    fields.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Genes that have experienced accelerated evolutionary
    rates on the human lineage during recent evolution are candidates for
    involvement in human-specific adaptations. To determine the forces that
    cause increased evolutionary rates in certain genes, we analyzed
    alignments of 10,238 human genes to their orthologues in chimpanzee and
    macaque. Using a likelihood ratio test, we identified protein-coding
    sequences with an accelerated rate of base substitutions along the human
    lineage. Exons evolving at a fast rate in humans have a significant
    tendency to contain clusters of AT-to-GC (weak-to-strong) biased
    substitutions. This pattern is also observed in noncoding sequence
    flanking rapidly evolving exons. Accelerated exons occur in regions with
    elevated male recombination rates and exhibit an excess of nonsynonymous
    substitutions relative to the genomic average. We next analyzed genes
    with significantly elevated ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous rates
    of base substitution (dN/dS) along the human lineage, and those with an
    excess of amino acid replacement substitutions relative to human
    polymorphism. These genes also show evidence of clusters of
    weak-to-strong biased substitutions. These findings indicate that a
    recombination-associated process, such as biased gene conversion (BGC),
    is driving fixation of GC alleles in the human genome. This process can
    lead to accelerated evolution in coding sequences and excess amino acid
    replacement substitutions, thereby generating significant results for
    tests of positive selection.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Systematic annotation of gene regulatory elements is
    a major challenge in genome science. Direct mapping of chromatin
    modification marks and transcriptional factor binding sites genome-wide
    has successfully identified specific subtypes of regulatory elements. In
    Drosophila several pioneering studies have provided genome-wide
    identification of Polycomb response elements, chromatin states,
    transcription factor binding sites, RNA polymerase II regulation and
    insulator elements; however, comprehensive annotation of the regulatory
    genome remains a significant challenge. Here we describe results from the
    modENCODE cis-regulatory annotation project. We produced a map of the
    Drosophila melanogaster regulatory genome on the basis of more than 300
    chromatin immunoprecipitation data sets for eight chromatin features,
    five histone deacetylases and thirty-eight site-specific transcription
    factors at different stages of development. Using these data we inferred
    more than 20,000 candidate regulatory elements and validated a subset of
    predictions for promoters, enhancers and insulators in vivo. We
    identified also nearly 2,000 genomic regions of dense transcription
    factor binding associated with chromatin activity and accessibility. We
    discovered hundreds of new transcription factor co-binding relationships
    and defined a transcription factor network with over 800 potential
    regulatory relationships.>

    <bib-field|abstract|We report the generation and analysis of functional
    data from multiple, diverse experiments performed on a targeted 1\\% of
    the human genome as part of the pilot phase of the ENCODE Project. These
    data have been further integrated and augmented by a number of
    evolutionary and computational analyses. Together, our results advance
    the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major
    areas. First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is
    pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found
    in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and
    those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic
    examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding
    about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific
    regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone
    modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has
    emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA replication and
    transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of
    information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on
    inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new
    mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape
    of the human genome. Together, these studies are defining a path for
    pursuit of a more comprehensive characterization of human genome
    function.>

    <bib-field|abstract|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of small noncoding
    RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of target mRNA
    transcripts. Many of these target mRNA transcripts are involved in
    proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis1, 2, processes commonly
    altered during tumorigenesis. Recent work has shown a global decrease of
    mature miRNA expression in human cancers3. However, it is unclear whether
    this global repression of miRNAs reflects the undifferentiated state of
    tumors or causally contributes to the transformed phenotype. Here we show
    that global repression of miRNA maturation promotes cellular
    transformation and tumorigenesis. Cancer cells expressing short hairpin
    RNAs (shRNAs) targeting three different components of the miRNA
    processing machinery showed a substantial decrease in steady-state miRNA
    levels and a more pronounced transformed phenotype. In animals, miRNA
    processing–impaired cells formed tumors with accelerated kinetics.
    These tumors were more invasive than control tumors, suggesting that
    global miRNA loss enhances tumorigenesis. Furthermore, conditional
    deletion of Dicer1 enhanced tumor development in a K-Ras–induced mouse
    model of lung cancer. Overall, these studies indicate that abrogation of
    global miRNA processing promotes tumorigenesis.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The Gene Ontology (GO) project is a collaboration

    <bib-field|abstract|Gene order is not random with regard to gene
    expression in mammals: coexpressed genes, and in particular housekeeping
    genes, are clustered along chromosomes more often than expected by
    chance. To understand the origin of these clusters and to quantify the
    impact of this phenomenon on genome organization, we analyzed clusters of
    coexpressed genes in the human and mouse genomes. We show that
    neighboring genes experience continuous concerted expression changes
    during evolution, which leads to the formation of coexpressed gene
    clusters. The pattern of expression within these clusters evolves more
    slowly than the genomic average. Moreover, by studying gene order
    evolution, we show that some clusters are maintained by natural selection
    and, therefore, have a functional significance. However, we also
    demonstrate that some coexpressed gene clusters are the result of neutral
    coevolution effects, as illustrated by the clustering of genes escaping
    inactivation on the X chromosome. Moreover, we show that, although
    statistically significant, constraints on gene orders have a limited
    impact on mammalian genome organization, affecting only 3-5\\% of the
    pool of human and murine genes. It had been hypothesized that coexpressed
    gene clusters might correspond to large chromatin domains. In
    contradiction, we find that most of these clusters contain only 2 genes
    whose coexpression may be due to transcriptional read-through or the
    activity of bidirectional promoters.>

    <bib-field|abstract|In recent years the phylogenetic relationship of
    mammalian orders has been addressed in a number of molecular studies.
    These analyses have frequently yielded inconsistent results with respect
    to some basal ordinal relationships. For example, the relative placement
    of primates, rodents, and carnivores has differed in various studies.
    Here, we attempt to resolve this phylogenetic problem by using data from
    completely sequenced nuclear genomes to base the analyses on the largest
    possible amount of data. To minimize the risk of reconstruction
    artifacts, the trees were reconstructed under different
    criteria-distance, parsimony, and likelihood. For the distance trees,
    distance metrics that measure independent phenomena (amino acid
    replacement, synonymous substitution, and gene reordering) were used, as
    it is highly improbable that all of the trees would be affected the same
    way by any reconstruction artifact. In contradiction to the currently
    favored classification, our results based on full-genome analysis of the
    phylogenetic relationship between human, dog, and mouse yielded
    overwhelming support for a primate-carnivore clade with the exclusion of
    rodents.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Chromosomal instability is regarded as an underlying
    mechanism of neoplastic progression, integral to the clonal selection and
    evolution that leads to cancer. We evaluated chromosomal instability in
    premalignant Barrett's esophagus tissue using high resolution Affymetrix
    mapping 100K SNP arrays as patients progressed through three molecular
    stages of disease-CDKN2A(LOH) only, CDKN2A(LOH)/TP53(LOH), and
    CDKN2A(LOH)/TP53(LOH) with aneuploidy. Within individuals over time, we
    observed increases in both numbers and sizes of regions of LOH or copy
    number change. In the earliest CDKN2A(LOH) only samples, we detected few
    regions with both copy change and LOH, whereas copy loss and LOH were
    highly correlated in more advanced samples. These data indicate that
    genomic instability increases in severity and changes character during
    neoplastic progression. In addition, distinct patterns of clonal
    evolution could be discerned within a segment of Barrett's esophagus.
    Overall, this study illustrates that pre-malignant disease can be
    associated with extensive instability and clonal dynamics that evolve
    from an initial stage characterized by small recombination-based
    alterations to one with larger copy change events likely associated with
    mitotic instability.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Comparing gene expression profiles over many
    different conditions has led to insights that were not obvious from
    single experiments. In the same way, comparing patterns of natural
    selection across a set of ecologically distinct species may extend what
    can be learned from individual genome-wide surveys. Toward this end, we
    show how variation in protein evolutionary rates, after correcting for
    genome-wide effects such as mutation rate and demographic factors, can be
    used to estimate the level and types of natural selection acting on genes
    across different species. We identify unusually rapidly and slowly
    evolving genes, relative to empirically derived genome-wide and gene
    family-specific background rates for 744 core protein families in 30
    gamma-proteobacterial species. We describe the pattern of fast or slow
    evolution across species as the "selective signature" of a gene.
    Selective signatures represent a profile of selection across species that
    is predictive of gene function: pairs of genes with correlated selective
    signatures are more likely to share the same cellular function, and genes
    in the same pathway can evolve in concert. For example, glycolysis and
    phenylalanine metabolism genes evolve rapidly in Idiomarina loihiensis,
    mirroring an ecological shift in carbon source from sugars to amino
    acids. In a broader context, our results suggest that the genomic
    landscape is organized into functional modules even at the level of
    natural selection, and thus it may be easier than expected to understand
    the complex evolutionary pressures on a cell.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Correlated changes of nucleic or amino acids have
    provided strong information about the structures and interactions of
    molecules. Despite the rich literature in coevolutionary sequence
    analysis, previous methods often have to trade off between generality,
    simplicity, phylogenetic information, and specific knowledge about
    interactions. Furthermore, despite the evidence of coevolution in
    selected protein families, a comprehensive screening of coevolution among
    all protein domains is still lacking. We propose an augmented
    continuous-time Markov process model for sequence coevolution. The model
    can handle different types of interactions, incorporate phylogenetic
    information and sequence substitution, has only one extra free parameter,
    and requires no knowledge about interaction rules. We employ this model
    to large-scale screenings on the entire protein domain database (Pfam).
    Strikingly, with 0.1 trillion tests executed, the majority of the
    inferred coevolving protein domains are functionally related, and the
    coevolving amino acid residues are spatially coupled. Moreover, many of
    the coevolving positions are located at functionally important sites of
    proteins/protein complexes, such as the subunit linkers of superoxide
    dismutase, the tRNA binding sites of ribosomes, the DNA binding region of
    RNA polymerase, and the active and ligand binding sites of various
    enzymes. The results suggest sequence coevolution manifests structural
    and functional constraints of proteins. The intricate relations between
    sequence coevolution and various selective constraints are worth pursuing
    at a deeper level.>

    <bib-field|abstract|We describe the draft genome of the microcrustacean
    Daphnia pulex, which is only 200 megabases and contains at least 30,907
    genes. The high gene count is a consequence of an elevated rate of gene
    duplication resulting in tandem gene clusters. More than a third of
    Daphnia's genes have no detectable homologs in any other available
    proteome, and the most amplified gene families are specific to the
    Daphnia lineage. The coexpansion of gene families interacting within
    metabolic pathways suggests that the maintenance of duplicated genes is
    not random, and the analysis of gene expression under different
    environmental conditions reveals that numerous paralogs acquire divergent
    expression patterns soon after duplication. Daphnia-specific genes,
    including many additional loci within sequenced regions that are
    otherwise devoid of annotations, are the most responsive genes to
    ecological challenges.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Sperm competition favors increases in relative testes
    mass and production efficiency, and changes in sperm phenotype that
    result in faster swimming speeds. However, little is known about its
    effects on traits that contribute to determine the quality of a whole
    ejaculate (i.e., proportion of motile, viable, morphologically normal and
    acrosome intact sperm) and that are key determinants of fertilization
    success. Two competing hypotheses lead to alternative predictions: (a)
    sperm quantity and quality traits co-evolve under sperm competition
    because they play complementary roles in determining ejaculate's
    competitive ability, or (b) energetic constraints force trade-offs
    between traits depending on their relevance in providing a competitive
    advantage. We examined relationships between sperm competition levels,
    sperm quantity, and traits that determine ejaculate quality, in a
    comparative study of 18 rodent species using phylogenetically controlled
    analyses. Total sperm numbers were positively correlated to proportions
    of normal sperm, acrosome integrity and motile sperm; the latter three
    were also significantly related among themselves, suggesting no
    trade-offs between traits. In addition, testes mass corrected for body
    mass (i.e., relative testes mass), showed a strong association with sperm
    numbers, and positive significant associations with all sperm traits that
    determine ejaculate quality with the exception of live sperm. An "overall
    sperm quality" parameter obtained by principal component analysis (which
    explained 85\\% of the variance) was more strongly associated with
    relative testes mass than any individual quality trait. Overall sperm
    quality was as strongly associated with relative testes mass as sperm
    numbers. Thus, sperm quality traits improve under sperm competition in an
    integrated manner suggesting that a combination of all traits is what
    makes ejaculates more competitive. In evolutionary terms this implies
    that a complex network of genetic and developmental pathways underlying
    processes of sperm formation, maturation, transport in the female
    reproductive tract, and preparation for fertilization must all evolve in
    concert.>

    Group B has been observed primarily in European domestic sheep. The
    European mouflon carries this haplotype group. This could suggest that
    European mouflon was independently domesticated in Europe, although
    archaeological evidence supports sheep domestication in the central part
    of the Fertile Crescent. To investigate this question, we sequenced a
    highly variable segment of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in 406 unrelated
    animals from 48 breeds or local varieties. They originated from a wide
    area spanning northern Europe and the Balkans to the Altay Mountains in
    south Siberia. The sample included a representative cross-section of
    sheep breeds from areas close to the postulated Near Eastern
    domestication center and breeds from more distant northern areas. Four
    (A, B, C, and D) highly diverged sheep lineages were observed in
    Caucasus, 3 (A, B and C) in Central Asia, and 2 (A and B) in the eastern
    fringe of Europe, which included the area north and west of the Black Sea
    and the Ural Mountains. Only one example of Group D was detected. The
    other haplotype groups demonstrated signs of population expansion.
    Sequence variation within the lineages implied Group A to have expanded
    first. This group was the most frequent type only in Caucasian and
    Central Asian breeds. Expansion of Group C appeared most recently. The
    expansion of Group B involving Caucasian sheep took place at nearly the
    same time as the expansion of Group A. Group B expansion for the eastern
    European area started approximately 3,000 years after the earliest
    inferred expansion. An independent European domestication of sheep is
    unlikely. The distribution of Group A variation as well as other results
    are compatible with the Near East being the domestication site. Groups C
    and D may have been introgressed later into a domestic stock, but larger
    samples are needed to infer their geographical origin. The results
    suggest that some mitochondrial lineages arrived in northern Europe from
    the Near East across Russia. 10.1093/molbev/msl043>

    <bib-field|abstract|A growing debate in evolutionary and developmental
    biology concerns the relative contribution of cis-regulatory and protein
    (particularly transcription factor) changes to developmental evolution.
    Central to this argument are the perceived conservation of transcription
    factor functions and the modular architecture of cis-regulatory elements.
    In this paper, we review recent studies on transcription factor proteins
    that show that transcription factor genes undergo adaptive evolution and
    evolve novel functions that contribute to the evolution of development.
    Furthermore, we review experimental work that shows that transcription
    factor proteins are modular and can evolve with minimal pleiotropic
    effects. We conclude that changes in the function of proteins are likely
    directly contributing to developmental evolution.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The protamines are a diverse family of small
    arginine-rich proteins that are synthesized in the late-stage spermatids
    of many animals and plants and bind to DNA, condensing the spermatid
    genome into a genetically inactive state. Vertebrates have from one to 15
    protamine genes per haploid genome, which are clustered together on the
    same chromosome. Comparison of protamine gene and amino-acid sequences
    suggests that the family evolved from specialized histones through
    protamine-like proteins to the true protamines. Structural elements
    present in all true protamines are a series of arginine-rich
    DNA-anchoring domains (often containing a mixture of arginine and lysine
    residues in non-mammalian protamines) and multiple phosphorylation sites.
    The two protamines found in mammals, P1 and P2, are the most widely
    studied. P1 packages sperm DNA in all mammals, whereas protamine P2 is
    present only in the sperm of primates, many rodents and a subset of other
    placental mammals. P2, but not P1, is synthesized as a precursor that
    undergoes proteolytic processing after binding to DNA and also binds a
    zinc atom, the function of which is not known. P1 and P2 are
    phosphorylated soon after their synthesis, but after binding to DNA most
    of the phosphate groups are removed and cysteine residues are oxidized,
    forming disulfide bridges that link the protamines together. Both P1 and
    P2 have been shown to be required for normal sperm function in primates
    and many rodents.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Both somatic cells and sperm have been shown to take
    up exogenous DNA, but the frequency of its integration is usually low.
    Scanning probe microscopy studies of sperm chromatin and synthetic
    DNA-protamine complexes indicate that the coiling of DNA into toroidal
    subunits, a process initiated in the maturing spermatid to prepare its
    genome for delivery into the egg, can be mimicked by simply adding
    protamine to DNA in vitro. The increased resistance of DNA-protamine
    complexes to nuclease digestion and their structural similarity to native
    sperm chromatin suggest that the packaging of DNA by protamine might
    offer a new approach for improving the efficiency of DNA uptake by sperm.
    Decondensation experiments performed with individual DNA molecules have
    provided a direct measure of the stability of toroids produced using
    salmon protamine and smaller arginine-rich peptides. These experiments
    show that the arginine content of protamine-related sequences can have a
    dramatic effect on their rate of dissociation from DNA. This technique
    and the information it provides can be used to identify protamine analogs
    that can be bound to DNA to increase the efficiency of its uptake by
    sperm and other cells.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Phylogenetic reconstruction is the method of choice
    to determine the homologous relationships between sequences. Difficulties
    in producing high-quality alignments, which are the basis of good trees,
    and in automating the analysis of trees have unfortunately limited the
    use of phylogenetic reconstruction methods to individual genes or gene
    families. Due to the large number of sequences involved, phylogenetic
    analyses of proteomes preclude manual steps and therefore require a high
    degree of automation in sequence selection, alignment, phylogenetic
    inference and analysis of the resulting set of trees. We present a set of
    programs that automates the steps from seed sequence to phylogeny and a
    utility to extract all phylogenies that match specific topological
    constraints from a database of trees. Two example applications that show
    the type of questions that can be answered by phylome analysis are
    provided. The generation and analysis of the Thermoplasma acidophilum
    phylome with regard to lateral gene transfer between Thermoplasmata and
    Sulfolobus, showed best BLAST hits to be far less reliable indicators of
    lateral transfer than the corresponding protein phylogenies. The
    generation and analysis of the Danio rerio phylome provided more than
    twice as many proteins as described previously, supporting the hypothesis
    of an additional round of genome duplication in the actinopterygian

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs have emerged as important
    regulatory genes in a variety of cellular processes and, in recent years,
    hundreds of such genes have been discovered in animals. In contrast,
    functional annotations are available only for a very small fraction of
    these miRNAs, and even in these cases only partially. RESULTS: We
    developed a general Bayesian method for the inference of miRNA target
    sites, in which, for each miRNA, we explicitly model the evolution of
    orthologous target sites in a set of related species. Using this method
    we predict target sites for all known miRNAs in flies, worms, fish, and
    mammals. By comparing our predictions in fly with a reference set of
    experimentally tested miRNA-mRNA interactions we show that our general
    method performs at least as well as the most accurate methods available
    to date, including ones specifically tailored for target prediction in
    fly. An important novel feature of our model is that it explicitly infers
    the phylogenetic distribution of functional target sites, independently
    for each miRNA. This allows us to infer species-specific and
    clade-specific miRNA targeting. We also show that, in long human 3' UTRs,
    miRNA target sites occur preferentially near the start and near the end
    of the 3' UTR. To characterize miRNA function beyond the predicted lists
    of targets we further present a method to infer significant associations
    between the sets of targets predicted for individual miRNAs and specific
    biochemical pathways, in particular those of the KEGG pathway database.
    We show that this approach retrieves several known functional miRNA-mRNA
    associations, and predicts novel functions for known miRNAs in cell
    growth and in development. CONCLUSION: We have presented a Bayesian
    target prediction algorithm without any tunable parameters, that can be
    applied to sequences from any clade of species. The algorithm
    automatically infers the phylogenetic distribution of functional sites
    for each miRNA, and assigns a posterior probability to each putative
    target site. The results presented here indicate that our general method
    achieves very good performance in predicting miRNA target sites,
    providing at the same time insights into the evolution of target sites
    for individual miRNAs. Moreover, by combining our predictions with
    pathway analysis, we propose functions of specific miRNAs in nervous
    system development, inter-cellular communication and cell growth. The
    complete target site predictions as well as the miRNA/pathway
    associations are accessible on the ElMMo web server.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Male reproductive genes often evolve very rapidly,
    and sexual selection is thought to be a primary force driving this
    divergence. We investigated the molecular evolution of 987 genes
    expressed at different times during mouse spermatogenesis to determine if
    the rate of evolution and the intensity of positive selection vary across
    stages of male gamete development. Using mouse-rat orthologs, we found
    that rates of protein evolution were positively correlated with the
    developmental timing of expression. Genes expressed early in
    spermatogenesis had rates of divergence similar to the genome median,
    while genes expressed after the onset of meiosis were found to evolve
    much more quickly. Rates of protein evolution were fastest for genes
    expressed during the dramatic morphogenesis of round spermatids into
    spermatozoa. Late-expressed genes were also more likely to be specific to
    the male germline. To test for evidence of positive selection, we
    analyzed the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes using a maximum
    likelihood framework in comparisons among mouse, rat, and human. Many
    genes showed evidence of positive selection, and most of these genes were
    expressed late in spermatogenesis and were testis specific. Overall,
    these data suggest that the intensity of positive selection associated
    with the evolution of male gametes varies considerably across development
    and acts primarily on phenotypes that develop late in spermatogenesis.>

    high proportion of young gene duplicates in the human, macaque, mouse,
    and rat genomes have experienced adaptive natural selection.
    Approximately 10\\% of all lineage-specific duplicates show evidence for
    positive selection on their protein sequences, larger than any reported
    amount of selection among single-copy genes in these lineages using
    similar methods. We also find that newly duplicated genes that have been
    transposed to new chromosomal locations are significantly more likely to
    have undergone positive selection than the ancestral copy. Human-specific
    duplicates evolving under adaptive natural selection include a surprising
    number of genes involved in neuronal and cognitive functions. Our results
    imply that genome scans for selection that ignore duplicated loci are
    missing a large fraction of all adaptive substitutions. The results are
    also in agreement with the classical model of evolution by gene
    duplication, supporting a common role for neofunctionalization in the
    long-term maintenance of gene duplicates.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Genome-wide scans for positively selected genes
    (PSGs) in mammals have provided insight into the dynamics of genome
    evolution, the genetic basis of differences between species, and the
    functions of individual genes. However, previous scans have been limited
    in power and accuracy owing to small numbers of available genomes. Here
    we present the most comprehensive examination of mammalian PSGs to date,
    using the six high-coverage genome assemblies now available for eutherian
    mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset results in
    substantially improved statistical power, and permits several new
    lineage- and clade-specific tests to be applied. Of approximately 16,500
    human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two other species,
    400 genes showed significant evidence of positive selection (FDR\<0.05),
    according to a standard likelihood ratio test. An additional 144 genes
    showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades.
    As in previous studies, the identified PSGs were enriched for roles in
    defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but
    enrichments were also evident for more specific functions, such as
    complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. Several pathways were
    strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible co-evolution of
    interacting genes. A novel Bayesian analysis of the possible "selection
    histories" of each gene indicated that most PSGs have switched multiple
    times between positive selection and nonselection, suggesting that
    positive selection is often episodic. A detailed analysis of Affymetrix
    exon array data indicated that PSGs are expressed at significantly lower
    levels, and in a more tissue-specific manner, than non-PSGs. Genes that
    are specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast are
    significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an
    enrichment for PSGs among brain-specific genes. This study provides
    additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian
    evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications
    of positive selection.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Organismic evolution requires that variation at
    distinct hierarchical levels and attributes be coherently integrated,
    often in the face of disparate environmental and genetic pressures. A
    central part of the evolutionary analysis of biological systems remains
    to decipher the causal connections between organism-wide (or genome-wide)
    attributes (e.g., mRNA abundance, protein length, codon bias,
    recombination rate, genomic position, mutation rate, etc) as well as
    their role–together with mutation, selection, and genetic drift–in
    shaping patterns of evolutionary variation in any of the attributes
    themselves. Here we combine genome-wide evolutionary analysis of protein
    and gene expression data to highlight fundamental relationships among
    genomic attributes and their associations with the evolution of both
    protein sequences and gene expression levels. Our results show that
    protein divergence is positively coupled with both gene expression
    polymorphism and divergence. We show moreover that although the number of
    protein-protein interactions in Drosophila is negatively associated with
    protein divergence as well as gene expression polymorphism and
    divergence, protein-protein interactions cannot account for the observed
    coupling between regulatory and structural evolution. Furthermore, we
    show that proteins with higher rates of amino acid substitutions tend to
    have larger sizes and tend to be expressed at lower mRNA abundances,
    whereas genes with higher levels of gene expression divergence and
    polymorphism tend to have shorter sizes and tend to be expressed at
    higher mRNA abundances. Finally, we show that protein length is
    negatively associated with both number of protein-protein interactions
    and mRNA abundance and that interacting proteins in Drosophila show
    similar amounts of divergence. We suggest that protein sequences and gene
    expression are subjected to similar evolutionary dynamics, possibly
    because of similarity in the fitness effect (i.e., strength of
    stabilizing selection) of disruptions in a gene's protein sequence or its
    mRNA expression. We conclude that, as more and better data accumulate,
    understanding the causal connections among biological traits and how they
    are integrated over time to constrain or promote structural and
    regulatory evolution may finally become possible. 10.1093/molbev/msi122>

    <bib-field|abstract|Protein-protein interactions effectively mediate
    molecular function. They are the result of specific interactions between
    protein interfaces and are maintained by the action of evolutionary
    pressure on the regions of the interacting proteins that contribute to
    binding. For the most part selection restricts amino acid replacements,
    accounting for the conservation of binding interfaces. However, in some
    cases, change in one protein will be mitigated by compensatory change in
    its binding partner, maintaining function in the face of evolutionary
    change. There have been several attempts to use correlations in sequence
    evolution to predict interactions of proteins. Most commonly, these
    approaches use the entire sequence to identify correlations and so infer
    probable binding. However, other factors such as shared evolutionary
    history and similarities in the rates of evolution confound these
    whole-sequence based approaches. Here we discuss recent work on this
    topic and argue that both site-specific coevolutionary change and
    whole-sequence correlations contribute to evolutionary change in sets of
    interacting proteins. We discuss the relative effects of both types of
    selection and how they might be identified. This permits an integrated
    view of protein-protein interactions, their evolution and coevolution.>

    selection responds to a change in selection: beneficial changes also
    occur at evolutionary equilibrium, repairing previous deleterious changes
    and restoring existing functions. Adaptation, by contrast, is viewed here
    as a non-equilibrium phenomenon: the genomic response to time-dependent
    selection. Our approach extends the static concept of fitness landscapes
    to dynamic fitness seascapes. It shows that adaptation requires a surplus

    <bib-field|abstract|Using the genomic sequences of Drosophila
    melanogaster subgroup, the pattern of gene duplications was investigated
    with special attention to interlocus gene conversion. Our fine-scale
    analysis with careful visual inspections enabled accurate identification
    of a number of duplicated blocks (genomic regions). The orthologous parts
    of those duplicated blocks were also identified in the D. simulans and D.
    sechellia genomes, by which we were able to clearly classify the
    duplicated blocks into post- and pre-speciation blocks. We found 31
    post-speciation duplicated genes, from which the rate of gene duplication
    (from one copy to two copies) is estimated to be 1.0 x 10(-9) per
    single-copy gene per year. The role of interlocus gene conversion was
    observed in several respects in our data: (1) synonymous divergence
    between a duplicated pair is overall very low. Consequently, the gene
    duplication rate would be seriously overestimated by counting duplicated
    genes with low divergence; (2) the sizes of young duplicated blocks are
    generally large. We postulate that the degeneration of gene conversion
    around the edges could explain the shrinkage of "identifiable" duplicated
    regions; and (3) elevated paralogous divergence is observed around the
    edges in many duplicated blocks, supporting our gene
    conversion-degeneration model. Our analysis demonstrated that gene
    conversion between duplicated regions is a common and genome-wide
    phenomenon in the Drosophila genomes, and that its role should be
    especially significant in the early stages of duplicated genes. Based on
    a population genetic prediction, we applied a new genome-scan method to
    test for signatures of selection for neofunctionalization and found a
    strong signature in a pair of transporter genes.>

    <bib-field|abstract|In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a
    major class of regulatory genes, present in most metazoans and important
    for a diverse range of biological functions. Because experimental
    identification of miRNA targets is difficult, there has been an explosion
    of computational target predictions. Although the initial round of
    predictions resulted in very diverse results, subsequent computational
    and experimental analyses suggested that at least a certain class of
    conserved miRNA targets can be confidently predicted and that this class
    of targets is large, covering, for example, at least 30\\% of all human
    genes when considering about 60 conserved vertebrate miRNA gene families.
    Most recent approaches have also shown that there are correlations
    between domains of miRNA expression and mRNA levels of their targets. Our
    understanding of miRNA function is still extremely limited, but it may be
    that by integrating mRNA and miRNA sequence and expression data with
    other comparative genomic data, we will be able to gain global and yet
    specific insights into the function and evolution of a broad layer of

    between relative testis size and the prevalence of within-litter multiple
    paternity, consistent with previous analyses in which relative testis
    size has been found to correlate with sperm competition levels inferred
    from social organization and mating systems. We further demonstrate an
    association between sperm competition level and the relative size of at
    least two accessory reproductive glands: the seminal vesicles and
    anterior prostate. The size of the major product of these glands-the
    copulatory plug-is also found to vary with sperm competition level. Our
    findings thus suggest that selection for larger plugs under sperm
    competition may explain variation in accessory gland size, and highlight
    the need to consider both sperm and non-sperm components of the male
    ejaculate in the context of post-copulatory sexual selection.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Classically, the functional consequences of natural
    selection over genomes have been analyzed as the compound effects of
    individual genes. The current paradigm for large-scale analysis of
    adaptation is based on the observed significant deviations of rates of
    individual genes from neutral evolutionary expectation. This approach,
    which assumed independence among genes, has not been able to identify
    biological functions significantly enriched in positively selected genes
    in individual species. Alternatively, pooling related species has
    enhanced the search for signatures of selection. However, grouping
    signatures does not allow testing for adaptive differences between
    species. Here we introduce the Gene-Set Selection Analysis (GSSA), a new
    genome-wide approach to test for evidences of natural selection on
    functional modules. GSSA is able to detect lineage specific evolutionary
    rate changes in a notable number of functional modules. For example, in
    nine mammal and Drosophilae genomes GSSA identifies hundreds of
    functional modules with significant associations to high and low rates of
    evolution. Many of the detected functional modules with high evolutionary
    rates have been previously identified as biological functions under
    positive selection. Notably, GSSA identifies conserved functional modules
    with many positively selected genes, which questions whether they are
    exclusively selected for fitting genomes to environmental changes. Our
    results agree with previous studies suggesting that adaptation requires
    positive selection, but not every mutation under positive selection
    contributes to the adaptive dynamical process of the evolution of
    species.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Rapid evolution driven by positive Darwinian
    selection is a recurrent theme in male reproductive protein evolution. In
    contrast, positive selection has never been demonstrated for female
    reproductive proteins. Here, we perform phylogeny-based tests on three
    female mammalian fertilization proteins and demonstrate positive
    selection promoting their divergence. Two of these female fertilization
    proteins, the zona pellucida glycoproteins ZP2 and ZP3, are part of the
    mammalian egg coat. Several sites identified in ZP3 as likely to be under
    positive selection are located in a region previously demonstrated to be
    involved in species-specific sperm-egg interaction, suggesting the
    selective pressure is related to male-female interaction. The results
    provide long-sought evidence for two evolutionary hypotheses: sperm
    competition and sexual conflict.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Phylemon is an online platform for phylogenetic and
    evolutionary analyses of molecular sequence data. It has been developed
    as a web server that integrates a suite of different tools selected among
    the most popular stand-alone programs in phylogenetic and evolutionary

    demand of data analysis of many experimental scientists wishing to add a
    molecular evolution and phylogenetics insight into their research. Tools
    included in Phylemon cover a wide yet selected range of programs: from
    the most basic for multiple sequence alignment to elaborate statistical
    methods of phylogenetic reconstruction including methods for evolutionary
    rates analyses and molecular adaptation. Phylemon has several features
    that differentiates it from other resources: (i) It offers an integrated
    environment that enables the direct concatenation of evolutionary
    analyses, the storage of results and handles required data format
    conversions, (ii) Once an outfile is produced, Phylemon suggests the next
    possible analyses, thus guiding the user and facilitating the integration
    of multi-step analyses, and (iii) users can define and save complete
    pipelines for specific phylogenetic analysis to be automatically used on
    many genes in subsequent sessions or multiple genes in a single session

    <bib-field|abstract|Identifying genomic regions that have been targets of
    natural selection remains one of the most important and challenging areas
    of research in genetics. To this end, we report an analysis of 26,530
    single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with allele frequencies that were
    determined in three populations. Specifically, we calculated a measure of
    genetic differentiation, F(ST), for each locus and examined its
    distribution at the level of the genome, the chromosome, and individual
    genes. Through a variety of analyses, we have found statistically
    significant evidence supporting the hypothesis that selection has
    influenced extant patterns of human genetic variation. Importantly, by
    contrasting the F(ST) of individual SNPs to the empirical genome-wide
    distribution of F(ST), our results are not confounded by tenuous
    assumptions of population demographic history. Furthermore, we have
    identified 174 candidate genes with distribution of genetic variation
    that indicates that they have been targets of selection. Our work
    provides a first generation natural selection map of the human genome and
    provides compelling evidence that selection has shaped extant patterns of
    human genomic variation.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Array comparative genomic hybridization, with a
    genome-wide resolution of approximately 1 Mb, has been used to
    investigate copy number changes in 48 colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines
    and 37 primary CRCs. The samples were divided for analysis according to
    the type of genomic instability that they exhibit, microsatellite
    instability (MSI) or chromosomal instability (CIN). Consistent copy
    number changes were identified, including gain of chromosomes 20, 13, and
    8q and smaller regions of amplification such as chromosome 17q11.2-q12.
    Loss of chromosome 18q was a recurrent finding along with deletion of
    discrete regions such as chromosome 4q34-q35. The overall pattern of copy
    number change was strikingly similar between cell lines and primary
    cancers with a few obvious exceptions such as loss of chromosome 6 and
    gain of chromosomes 15 and 12p in the former. A greater number of
    aberrations were detected in CIN+ than MSI+ samples as well as
    differences in the type and extent of change reported. For example, loss
    of chromosome 8p was a common event in CIN+ cell lines and cancers but
    was often found to be gained in MSI+ cancers. In addition, the target of
    amplification on chromosome 8q appeared to differ, with 8q24.21 amplified
    frequently in CIN+ samples but 8q24.3 amplification a common finding in
    MSI+ samples. A number of genes of interest are located within the
    frequently aberrated regions, which are likely to be of importance in the
    development and progression of CRC.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Motivation: In functional genomics, it is frequently
    useful to correlate expression levels of genes to identify transcription
    factor binding sites (TFBS) via the presence of common sequence motifs.
    The underlying assumption is that co-expressed genes are more likely to
    contain shared TFBS and, thus, TFBS can be identified computationally.
    Indeed, gene pairs with a very high expression correlation show a
    significant excess of shared binding sites in yeast. We have tested this
    assumption in a more complex organism, Drosophila melanogaster, by using
    experimentally determined TFBS and microarray expression data. We have
    also examined the reverse relationship between the expression correlation
    and the extent of TFBS sharing. Results: Pairs of genes with shared TFBS
    show, on average, a higher degree of co-expression than those with no
    common TFBS in Drosophila. However, the reverse does not hold true: gene
    pairs with high expression correlations do not share significantly larger
    numbers of TFBS. Exception to this observation exists when comparing
    expression of genes from the earliest stages of embryonic development.
    Interestingly, semantic similarity between gene annotations (Biological
    Process) is much better associated with TFBS sharing, as compared to the
    expression correlation. We discuss these results in light of reverse
    engineering approaches to computationally predict regulatory sequences by
    using comparative genomics. Contact: amarcoca@asu.edu

    <bib-field|abstract|Species abundance distributions (SADs) follow one of
    ecology's oldest and most universal laws--every community shows a hollow
    curve or hyperbolic shape on a histogram with many rare species and just
    a few common species. Here, we review theoretical, empirical and
    statistical developments in the study of SADs. Several key points emerge.
    (i) Literally dozens of models have been proposed to explain the hollow
    curve. Unfortunately, very few models are ever rejected, primarily
    because few theories make any predictions beyond the hollow-curve SAD
    itself. (ii) Interesting work has been performed both empirically and
    theoretically, which goes beyond the hollow-curve prediction to provide a
    rich variety of information about how SADs behave. These include the
    study of SADs along environmental gradients and theories that integrate
    SADs with other biodiversity patterns. Central to this body of work is an
    effort to move beyond treating the SAD in isolation and to integrate the
    SAD into its ecological context to enable making many predictions. (iii)
    Moving forward will entail understanding how sampling and scale affect
    SADs and developing statistical tools for describing and comparing SADs.
    We are optimistic that SADs can provide significant insights into basic
    and applied ecological science.>

    <bib-field|abstract|In recent years, there have been major developments
    of population genetics methods to estimate both rates of recombination
    and levels of natural selection. However, genomic variants subject to
    positive selection are likely to have arisen recently and, consequently,
    had less opportunity to be affected by recombination. Thus, the two
    processes have an intimately related impact on genetic variation, and
    inference of either may be vulnerable to confounding by the other. We
    illustrate here that even modest levels of positive selection can
    substantially reduce population-based recombination rate estimates. We
    also show that genome-wide scans to detect loci under recent selection in
    humans have tended to highlight loci in regions of low recombination,
    suggesting that confounding by recombination rate may have reduced the
    power of these studies. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new
    genome-wide approach for detecting selection, based on the ratio of
    pedigree-based to population-based estimates of recombination rate.
    Simulations suggest that our "Ped/Pop" method, which is designed to
    capture completed sweeps, has good power to discriminate between neutral
    and adaptive evolution. Unusually for a multimarker method, our approach
    performs well in regions of high recombination and also has good power
    for many generations after the fixation of an advantageous variant. We
    apply the method to human HapMap and Perlegen data sets, finding
    confirmation of reported candidates as well as identifying new loci that
    may have undergone recent intense selection.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The ongoing generation of prodigious amounts of
    genomic sequence data from myriad vertebrates is providing unparalleled
    opportunities for establishing definitive phylogenetic relationships
    among species. The size and complexities of such comparative sequence
    data sets not only allow smaller and more difficult branches to be
    resolved but also present unique challenges, including large
    computational requirements and the negative consequences of systematic
    biases. To explore these issues and to clarify the phylogenetic
    relationships among mammals, we have analyzed a large data set of over 60
    megabase pairs (Mb) of high-quality genomic sequence, which we generated
    from 41 mammals and 3 other vertebrates. All sequences are orthologous to
    a 1.9-Mb region of the human genome that encompasses the cystic fibrosis
    transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). To understand the
    characteristics and challenges associated with phylogenetic analyses of
    such a large data set, we partitioned the sequence data in several ways
    and utilized maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and Neighbor-Joining
    algorithms, implemented in parallel on Linux clusters. These studies
    yielded well-supported phylogenetic trees, largely confirming other
    recent molecular phylogenetic analyses. Our results provide support for
    rooting the placental mammal tree between Atlantogenata (Xenarthra and
    Afrotheria) and Boreoeutheria (Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria),
    illustrate the difficulty in resolving some branches even with large
    amounts of data (e.g., in the case of Laurasiatheria), and demonstrate
    the valuable role that very large comparative sequence data sets can play
    in refining our understanding of the evolutionary relationships of

    <bib-field|abstract|The detection of positive Darwinian selection
    affecting protein-coding genes remains a topic of great interest and
    importance. The "branch-site" test is designed to detect localized
    episodic bouts of positive selection that affect only a few amino-acid
    residues on particular lineages, and has been shown to have reasonable
    power and low false positive rates for a wide range of selection schemes.
    Previous simulations examining the performance of the test, however, were
    conducted under idealized conditions without insertions, deletions or
    alignment errors. As the test is sometimes used to analyze divergent
    sequences, the impact of indels and alignment errors is a major concern.
    Here we used a recently developed indel-simulation program to examine the
    false-positive rate and power of the branch-site test. We find that
    insertions and deletions do not cause excessive false positives if the
    alignment is correct, but alignment errors can lead to unacceptably high
    false positives. Of the alignment methods evaluated, PRANK consistently
    outperformed MUSCLE, MAFFT and ClustalW, mostly because the latter
    programs tend to place non-homologous codons (or amino-acids) into the
    same column, producing shorter and less accurate alignments and giving
    the false impression that many amino acid substitutions have occurred at
    those sites. Our examination of two previous studies suggests that
    alignment errors may impact the analysis of mammalian and vertebrate
    genes by the branch-site test and it is important to use reliable
    alignment methods.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Understanding genome and chromosome evolution is
    important for understanding genetic inheritance and evolution. Universal
    events comprising DNA replication, transcription, repair, mobile genetic
    element transposition, chromosome rearrangements, mitosis, and meiosis
    underlie inheritance and variation of living organisms. Although the
    genome of a species as a whole is important, chromosomes are the basic
    units subjected to genetic events that coin evolution to a large extent.
    Now many complete genome sequences are available, we can address
    evolution and variation of individual chromosomes across species. For
    example, "How are the repeat and nonrepeat proportions of genetic codes
    distributed among different chromosomes in a multichromosome species?"
    "Is there a general rule behind the intuitive observation that chromosome
    lengths tend to be similar in a species, and if so, can we generalize any
    findings in chromosome content and size across different taxonomic
    groups?" Here, we show that chromosomes within a species do not show
    dramatic fluctuation in their content of mobile genetic elements as the
    proliferation of these elements increases from unicellular eukaryotes to
    vertebrates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, notwithstanding the
    remarkable plasticity, there is an upper limit to chromosome-size
    variation in diploid eukaryotes with linear chromosomes. Strikingly,
    variation in chromosome size for 886 chromosomes in 68 eukaryotic genomes
    (including 22 human autosomes) can be viably captured by a single model,
    which predicts that the vast majority of the chromosomes in a species are
    expected to have a base pair length between 0.4035 and 1.8626 times the
    average chromosome length. This conserved boundary of chromosome-size
    variation, which prevails across a wide taxonomic range with few
    exceptions, indicates that cellular, molecular, and evolutionary
    mechanisms, possibly together, confine the chromosome lengths around a
    species-specific average chromosome length.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The tailoring of existing genetic systems to new uses
    is called genetic co-option. Mechanisms of genetic co-option have been
    difficult to study because of difficulties in identifying functionally
    important changes. One way to study genetic co-option in protein-coding
    genes is to identify those amino acid sites that have experienced changes
    in selective pressure following a genetic co-option event. In this paper
    we present a maximum likelihood method useful for measuring divergent
    selective pressures and identifying the amino acid sites affected by
    divergent selection. The method is based on a codon model of evolution
    and uses the nonsynonymous-to-synonymous rate ratio (omega) as a measure
    of selection on the protein, with omega = 1, \< 1, and \> 1 indicating
    neutral evolution, purifying selection, and positive selection,
    respectively. The model allows variation in omega among sites, with a
    fraction of sites evolving under divergent selective pressures. Divergent
    selection is indicated by different omega's between clades, such as
    between paralogous clades of a gene family. We applied the codon model to
    duplication followed by functional divergence of (i) the epsilon and
    gamma globin genes and (ii) the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and
    eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) genes. In both cases likelihood ratio
    tests suggested the presence of sites evolving under divergent selective
    pressures. Results of the epsilon and gamma globin analysis suggested
    that divergent selective pressures might be a consequence of a weakened
    relationship between fetal hemoglobin and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. We
    suggest that empirical Bayesian identification of sites evolving under
    divergent selective pressures, combined with structural and functional
    information, can provide a valuable framework for identifying and
    studying mechanisms of genetic co-option. Limitations of the new method
    are discussed.>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: With the popularization of
    high-throughput techniques, the need for procedures that help in the
    biological interpretation of results has increased enormously. Recently,
    new procedures inspired in systems biology criteria have started to be
    developed. RESULTS: Here we present FatiScan, a web-based program which
    implements a threshold-independent test for the functional interpretation
    of large-scale experiments that does not depend on the pre-selection of
    genes based on the multiple application of independent tests to each
    gene. The test implemented aims to directly test the behaviour of blocks
    of functionally related genes, instead of focusing on single genes. In
    addition, the test does not depend on the type of the data used for
    obtaining significance values, and consequently different types of
    biologically informative terms (gene ontology, pathways, functional
    motifs, transcription factor binding sites or regulatory sites from
    CisRed) can be applied to different classes of genome-scale studies. We
    exemplify its application in microarray gene expression, evolution and
    interactomics. CONCLUSION: Methods for gene set enrichment which, in
    addition, are independent from the original data and experimental design
    constitute a promising alternative for the functional profiling of
    genome-scale experiments. A web server that performs the test described
    and other similar ones can be found at: http://www.babelomics.org.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Did the end-Cretaceous mass extinction event, by
    eliminating non-avian dinosaurs and most of the existing fauna, trigger
    the evolutionary radiation of present-day mammals? Here we construct,
    date and analyse a species-level phylogeny of nearly all extant Mammalia
    to bring a new perspective to this question. Our analyses of how extant
    lineages accumulated through time show that net per-lineage
    diversification rates barely changed across the Cretaceous/Tertiary
    boundary. Instead, these rates spiked significantly with the origins of
    the currently recognized placental superorders and orders approximately
    93 million years ago, before falling and remaining low until accelerating
    again throughout the Eocene and Oligocene epochs. Our results show that
    the phylogenetic 'fuses' leading to the explosion of extant placental
    orders are not only very much longer than suspected previously, but also
    challenge the hypothesis that the end-Cretaceous mass extinction event
    had a major, direct influence on the diversification of today's mammals.>

    <bib-field|abstract|In sharp contrast to the Darwinian theory of
    evolution by natural selection, the neutral theory claims that the
    overwhelming majority of evolutionary changes at the molecular level are
    caused by random fixation (due to random sampling drift in finite
    populations) of selectively neutral (i.e., selectively equivalent)
    mutants under continued inputs of mutations. The theory also asserts that
    most of the genetic variability within species at the molecular level
    (such as protein and DNA polymorphism) are selectively neutral or very
    nearly neutral and that they are maintained in the species by the balance
    between mutational input and random extinction. The neutral theory is
    based on simple assumptions, enabling us to develop mathematical theories
    based on population genetics to treat molecular evolution and variation
    in quantitative terms. The theory can be tested against actual
    observations. Neo-Darwinians continue to criticize the neutral theory,
    but evidence for it has accumulated over the last two decades. The recent
    outpouring of DNA sequence data has greatly strengthened the theory. In
    this paper, I review some recent observations that strongly support the
    neutral theory. They include such topics as pseudoglobin genes of the
    mouse, alpha A-crystallin genes of the blind mole rat, genes of influenza
    A virus and nuclear vs. mitochondrial genes of fruit flies. I also
    discuss such topics as the evolution of deviant coding systems in
    Mycoplasma, the origin of life and the unified understanding of molecular
    and phenotypic evolution. I conclude that since the origin of life on
    Earth, neutral evolutionary changes have predominated over Darwinian
    evolutionary changes, at least in number.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Identification of functional genomic regions using
    interspecies comparison will be most effective when the full span of
    relationships between genomic function and evolutionary constraint are
    utilized. We find that sets of putative transcriptional regulatory
    sequences, defined by ENCODE experimental data, have a wide span of
    evolutionary histories, ranging from stringent constraint shown by deep
    phylogenetic comparisons to recent selection on lineage-specific
    elements. This diversity of evolutionary histories can be captured, at
    least in part, by the suite of available comparative genomics tools,
    especially after correction for regional differences in the neutral
    substitution rate. Putative transcriptional regulatory regions show
    alignability in different clades, and the genes associated with them are
    enriched for distinct functions. Some of the putative regulatory regions
    show evidence for recent selection, including a primate-specific, distal
    promoter that may play a novel role in regulation.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The first third (ca. 1200 bp) of exon 1 of the
    nuclear gene encoding the interstitial retinoid-binding protein (IRBP)
    has been sequenced for 12 representative primates belonging to
    Lemuriformes, Lorisiformes, Tarsiiformes, Platyrrhini, and Catarrhini,
    and combined with available data (13 other primates, 11 nonprimate
    placentals, and 2 marsupials). Phylogenetic analyses using maximum
    likelihood on nucleotides and amino acids robustly support the monophyly
    of primates, Strepsirrhini, Lemuriformes, Lorisiformes, Anthropoidea,
    Catarrhini, and Platyrrhini. It is interesting to note that 1) Tarsiidae
    grouped with Anthropoidea, and the support for this node depends on the
    molecular characters considered; 2) Cheirogaleidae grouped within
    Lemuriformes; and 3) Daubentonia was the sister group of all other
    Lemuriformes. Study of the IRBP evolutionary rate shows a high
    heterogeneity within placentals and also within primates. Maximum
    likelihood local molecular clocks were assigned to three clades
    displaying significantly contrasted evolutionary rates. Paenungulata were
    shown to evolve 2.5-3 times faster than Perissodactyla and Lemuriformes.
    Six independent calibration points were used to estimate splitting ages
    of the main primate clades, and their compatibility was evaluated.
    Divergence ages were obtained for the following crown groups: 13.8-14.2
    MY for Lorisiformes, 26.5-27.2 MY for Lemuroidea, 39.6-40.7 MY for
    Lemuriformes, 45.4-46.7 MY for Strepsirrhini, and 56.7-58.4 MY for
    Haplorrhini. The incompatibility between some paleontological and
    molecular estimates may reflect the incompleteness of the placental
    fossil record, and/or indicate that the variable IRBP evolutionary rates
    are not fully accommodated by local molecular clocks. Am J Phys

    <bib-field|abstract|10.1073/pnas.0308721101 We present evidence that
    chordate protamines have evolved from histone H1. During the final stages
    of spermatogenesis, the compaction of DNA in many organisms is
    accomplished by the replacement of histones with a class of arginine-rich
    proteins called protamines. In other organisms, however, condensation of
    sperm DNA can occur with comparable efficiency in the presence of
    somatic-type histones or, alternatively, an intermediate class of
    proteins called protamine-like proteins. The idea that the highly
    specialized sperm chromosomal proteins (protamines) and somatic
    chromosomal proteins (histones) could be related dates back almost to the
    discovery of these proteins. Although this notion has frequently been
    revisited since that time, there has been a complete lack of supporting
    experimental evidence. Here we show that the emergence of protamines in
    chordates occurred very quickly, as a result of the conversion of a
    lysine-rich histone H1 to an arginine-rich protamine. We have
    characterized the sperm nuclear basic proteins of the tunicate , which we
    show consists of both a protamine and a sperm-specific histone H1 with a
    protamine tail. Comparison of the genes encoding these proteins to that
    of a sister protochordate, , has indicated this rapid and dramatic change
    is most likely the result of frameshift mutations in the tail of the
    sperm-specific histone H1. By establishing an evolutionary link between
    the chromatin-condensing histone H1s of somatic tissues and the
    chromatin-condensing proteins of the sperm, these results provide
    unequivocal support to the notion that vertebrate protamines evolved from
    histones.>

    loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants
    previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these
    results can be used to inform association and functional studies. From
    the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base
    substitution mutations to be approximately 1028 per base pair per
    generation. We explore the data with regard to signatures of natural
    selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic variation in the
    neighbourhood of genes, due to selection at linked sites. These methods
    and public data will support the next phase of human genetic research.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The human olfactory receptor (OR) repertoire is
    reduced in comparison to other mammals and to other nonhuman primates.
    Nonetheless, this olfactory decline opens an opportunity for evolutionary
    innovation and improvement. In the present study, we focus on an OR gene,
    OR5I1, which had previously been shown to present an excess of amino acid
    replacement substitutions between humans and chimpanzees. We analyze the
    genetic variation in OR5I1 in a large worldwide human panel and find an
    excess of derived alleles segregating at relatively high frequencies in
    all populations. Additional evidence for selection includes departures
    from neutrality in allele frequency spectra tests but no unusually
    extended haplotype structure. Moreover, molecular structural inference
    suggests that one of the nonsynonymous polymorphisms defining the
    presumably adaptive protein form of OR5I1 may alter the functional
    binding properties of the OR. These results are compatible with positive
    selection having modeled the pattern of variation found in the OR5I1 gene
    and with a relatively ancient, mild selective sweep predating the "Out of
    Africa" expansion of modern humans.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Abstract.\\&nbsp;\\&nbsp; We have characterized for
    the first time SNBPs from the hagfish Eptatratus stouti (Myxini) and the
    lamprey Lampetra tridentatus (Cephalaspidomorphi) and have found that
    histones are the major protein components of the sperm of these
    agnathans. We have also conducted a systematic analysis of SNBPs from
    different groups of chondrichthyan fishes, including the skate Raja rhina
    and seven species of sharks. Together with our previous data showing the
    sporadic nature of SNBP evolution in bony fish (Saperas, N., Ausio, J.,
    Lloris, D. and Chiva, M. [1994] J. Mol. Evol. 39: 282–295), the present
    study provides a unique insight into the overall evolutionary complexity
    and variability of the nuclear sperm proteins of fishes. It would appear
    that despite the discontinuous evolution of these proteins, the
    macroevolutionary pattern of histone (H type) → protamine-like (PL
    type) → protamine (P type) has been conserved in fish evolution, as it
    has in the evolution of other Deuterostomes.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The rate of molecular evolution can vary among
    lineages. Sources of this variation have differential effects on
    synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates. Changes in effective
    population size or patterns of natural selection will mainly alter
    nonsynonymous substitution rates. Changes in generation length or
    mutation rates are likely to have an impact on both synonymous and
    nonsynonymous substitution rates. By comparing changes in synonymous and
    nonsynonymous rates, the relative contributions of the driving forces of
    evolution can be better characterized. Here, we introduce a procedure for
    estimating the chronological rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous
    substitutions on the branches of an evolutionary tree. Because the widely
    used ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous rates is not designed to
    detect simultaneous increases or simultaneous decreases in synonymous and
    nonsynonymous rates, the estimation of these rates rather than their
    ratio can improve characterization of the evolutionary process. With our
    Bayesian approach, we analyze cytochrome oxidase subunit I evolution in
    primates and infer that nonsynonymous rates have a greater tendency to
    change over time than do synonymous rates. Our analysis of these data
    also suggests that rates have been positively correlated.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Mammalian fertilization exhibits species specificity,
    and the proteins mediating sperm-egg interactions evolve rapidly between
    species. In this study, we demonstrate that the evolution of seven genes
    involved in mammalian fertilization is promoted by positive Darwinian
    selection by using likelihood ratio tests (LRTs). Several of these
    proteins are sperm proteins that have been implicated in binding the
    mammalian egg coat zona pellucida glycoproteins, which were shown
    previously to be subjected to positive selection. Taken together, these
    represent the major candidates involved in mammalian fertilization,
    indicating positive selection is pervasive amongst mammalian reproductive
    proteins. A new LRT is implemented to determine if the d(N)/d(S) ratio is
    significantly greater than one. This is a more refined test of positive
    selection than the previous LRTs which only identified if there was a
    class of sites with a d(N)/d(S) ratio \>1 but did not test if that ratio
    was significantly greater than one.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The increasing number of sequenced genomes makes it
    possible to infer the evolutionary history of functional modules, i.e.,
    groups of proteins that contribute jointly to the same cellular function
    in a given species. Here we identify and analyze those prokaryotic
    functional modules, whose composition remains largely unchanged during
    evolution, and study their properties. Such "cohesive" modules have a
    large number of internal functional connections, encode genes that tend
    to be in close proximity in prokaryotic genomes, and correspond to
    physical complexes or complex functional systems like the flagellar
    apparatus. Cohesive modules are enriched in processes such as energy and
    amino acid metabolism, cell motility, and intracellular trafficking, or
    secretion. By grouping genes into modules we achieve a more precise
    estimate of their age and find that the young modules are often
    horizontally transferred between species and are enriched in functions
    involved in interactions with the environment, implying that they play an
    important role in the adaptation of species to new environments.>

    <bib-field|abstract|SUMMARY: Multiple sequence alignments are central to
    many areas of bioinformatics. It has been shown that the removal of
    poorly aligned regions from an alignment increases the quality of
    subsequent analyses. Such an alignment trimming phase is complicated in
    large-scale phylogenetic analyses that deal with thousands of alignments.
    Here, we present trimAl, a tool for automated alignment trimming, which
    is especially suited for large-scale phylogenetic analyses. trimAl can
    consider several parameters, alone or in multiple combinations, for

    <bib-field|abstract|In mouse spermatozoa, DNA is compacted by two
    protamines mP1 and mP2. Protamine mP2 (63 residues) is synthesized in
    spermatid nuclei as a precursor pmP2 (106 residues) which is subsequently
    processed at the end of spermiogenesis [Yelick, P.C., Balhorn, R.,
    Johnson, P.A., Corzett, M., Mazrimas, J.A., Kleene, K.C. \\& Hecht, N.B.
    (1987) Mol. Cell. Biol. 7, 2173-2179]. Six proteins, three of which were
    described earlier [Chauvi\\`{e}re, M., Martinage, A., Debarle, M., Alimi,
    E., Sauti\\`{e}re, P. \\& Chevaillier, Ph. (1991) C.R. Acad. Sci. 313,
    107-112], have molecular and electrophoretic properties similar to those
    of pmP2. They were isolated from purified testis nuclei and characterized
    by amino acid composition, N-terminal sequence and peptide mapping. From
    the amino acid compositions, it appears that all six proteins are rich in
    arginine, cysteine and histidine and are closely related to pmP2 and mP2.
    The N-terminal sequence of each protein overlaps a distinct region of the
    N-terminal part of pmP2. The C-terminal part of protamine mP2 starting at
    arginine 15 is common to all proteins as assessed by amino acid
    compositions and peptide maps. All these structural data demonstrate that
    the six isolated proteins are products of pmP2 precursor processing. The
    six intermediate proteins pmP2/5, pmP2/11, pmP2/16, pmP2/20, pmP2/26 and
    pmP2/32 which contain 102, 96, 91, 87, 81 and 75 residues, respectively,
    are generated from the pmP2 precursor after N-terminal excision of 4, 10,
    15, 19, 25 and 31 residues, respectively. The C-terminal sequence of
    protamine mP2 is strictly identical to that of its precursor; therefore,
    no maturation occurs in this part of the molecule. At the present time,
    the proteolytic pathway involved in the amino-terminal processing leading
    to the mature form of the protamine mP2 (63 residues) has not been
    elucidated. However, the different representation of six intermediates in
    the testis suggests that some stages of processing are faster than others
    or that some cleavage sites are preferred. The proteins described in this
    paper could result either from stepwise excision of N-terminal residues
    or from non-sequential cleavages.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Reproductive proteins maintain species-specific
    barriers to fertilization, affect the outcome of sperm competition,
    mediate reproductive conflicts between the sexes, and potentially
    contribute to the formation of new species. However, the specific
    proteins and molecular mechanisms that underlie these processes are
    understood in only a handful of cases. Advances in genomic and proteomic
    technologies enable the identification of large suites of reproductive
    proteins, making it possible to dissect reproductive phenotypes at the
    molecular level. We first review these technological advances and
    describe how reproductive proteins are identified in diverse animal taxa.
    We then discuss the dynamic evolution of reproductive proteins and the
    potential selective forces that act on them. Finally, we describe
    molecular and genomic tools for functional analysis and detail how
    evolutionary data may be used to make predictions about interactions
    among reproductive proteins.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The analysis of evolutionary rates is a popular
    approach to characterizing the effect of natural selection at the
    molecular level. Sequences contributing to species adaptation are
    expected to evolve faster than nonfunctional sequences because favourable
    mutations have a higher fixation probability than neutral ones. Such an
    accelerated rate of evolution might be due to factors other than natural
    selection, in particular GC-biased gene conversion. This is true of
    neutral sequences, but also of constrained sequences, which can be
    illustrated using the mouse Fxy gene. Several criteria can discriminate
    between the natural selection and biased gene conversion models. These
    criteria suggest that the recently reported human accelerated regions are
    most likely the result of biased gene conversion. We argue that these
    regions, far from contributing to human adaptation, might represent the
    Achilles' heel of our genome.>

    <bib-field|abstract|When females mate promiscuously, sperm from rival
    males compete within the female reproductive tract to fertilize ova.
    Sperm competition is a powerful selective force that has shaped sexual
    behavior, sperm production, and sperm morphology. However, nothing is
    known about the influence of sperm competition on fertilization-related
    processes, because it has been assumed that sperm competition only
    involves a race to reach the site of fertilization. We compared four
    closely related rodent species with different levels of sperm competition
    to examine whether there are differences in the proportion of spermatozoa
    that become ready to interact with the ovum ("capacitated") and in the
    proportion of spermatozoa that experience the acrosome reaction in
    response to a natural stimulant. Our results show that differences
    between species in levels of sperm competition were associated with the
    proportion of spermatozoa that undergo capacitation and with the
    proportion of spermatozoa that respond to progesterone, an
    ovum-associated signal. Sperm competition thus favors a larger population
    of spermatozoa that are competent to fertilize, and spermatozoa that are
    more sensitive to the signals emitted by the ovum and that may penetrate
    the ova vestments more rapidly. These results suggest that, contrary to
    previous assumptions, competition between spermatozoa from rival males
    continues at the site of fertilization. These findings may have further
    evolutionary implications because the enhanced competitiveness of
    spermatozoa during fertilization may increase the risk of polyspermy to
    females. This could lead to antagonistic coevolution between the sexes
    and may contribute to the explanation of the rapid divergence observed in
    fertilization-related traits.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The ability to predict gene content is highly
    desirable for characterization of not-yet sequenced genomes like those of
    dinoflagellates. Using data from completely sequenced and annotated
    genomes from phylogenetically diverse lineages, we investigated the
    relationship between gene content and genome size using regression
    analyses. Distinct relationships between log(10)-transformed
    protein-coding gene number (Y') versus log(10)-transformed genome size
    (X', genome size in kbp) were found for eukaryotes and non-eukaryotes.
    Eukaryotes best fit a logarithmic model, Y' = ln(-46.200+22.678X',
    whereas non-eukaryotes a linear model, Y' = 0.045+0.977X', both with high
    significance (p\<0.001, R(2)\>0.91). Total gene number shows similar
    trends in both groups to their respective protein coding regressions. The
    distinct correlations reflect lower and decreasing gene-coding
    percentages as genome size increases in eukaryotes (82\\%-1\\%) compared
    to higher and relatively stable percentages in prokaryotes and viruses
    (97\\%-47\\%). The eukaryotic regression models project that the smallest
    dinoflagellate genome (3x10(6) kbp) contains 38,188 protein-coding
    (40,086 total) genes and the largest (245x10(6) kbp) 87,688
    protein-coding (92,013 total) genes, corresponding to 1.8\\% and 0.05\\%
    gene-coding percentages. These estimates do not likely represent
    extraordinarily high functional diversity of the encoded proteome but
    rather highly redundant genomes as evidenced by high gene copy numbers
    documented for various dinoflagellate species.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Although sequences containing regulatory elements
    located close to protein-coding genes are often only weakly conserved
    during evolution, comparisons of rodent genomes have implied that these
    sequences are subject to some selective constraints. Evolutionary
    conservation is particularly apparent upstream of coding sequences and in
    first introns, regions that are enriched for regulatory elements. By
    comparing the human and chimpanzee genomes, we show here that there is
    almost no evidence for conservation in these regions in hominids.
    Furthermore, we show that gene expression is diverging more rapidly in
    hominids than in murids per unit of neutral sequence divergence. By
    combining data on polymorphism levels in human noncoding DNA and the
    corresponding human-chimpanzee divergence, we show that the proportion of
    adaptive substitutions in these regions in hominids is very low. It
    therefore seems likely that the lack of conservation and increased rate
    of gene expression divergence are caused by a reduction in the
    effectiveness of natural selection against deleterious mutations because
    of the low effective population sizes of hominids. This has resulted in
    the accumulation of a large number of deleterious mutations in sequences
    containing gene control elements and hence a widespread degradation of
    the genome during the evolution of humans and chimpanzees.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Here we present a draft genome sequence of the common
    chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). Through comparison with the human genome,
    we have generated a largely complete catalogue of the genetic differences
    that have accumulated since the human and chimpanzee species diverged
    from our common ancestor, constituting approximately thirty-five million
    single-nucleotide changes, five million insertion/deletion events, and
    various chromosomal rearrangements. We use this catalogue to explore the
    magnitude and regional variation of mutational forces shaping these two
    genomes, and the strength of positive and negative selection acting on
    their genes. In particular, we find that the patterns of evolution in
    human and chimpanzee protein-coding genes are highly correlated and
    dominated by the fixation of neutral and slightly deleterious alleles. We
    also use the chimpanzee genome as an outgroup to investigate human
    population genetics and identify signatures of selective sweeps in recent
    human evolution.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Understanding the early evolution of placental
    mammals is one of the most challenging issues in mammalian phylogeny.
    Here, we addressed this question by using the sequence data of the ENCODE
    consortium, which include 1\\&\\#37; of mammalian genomes in 18 species
    belonging to all main mammalian lineages. Phylogenetic reconstructions
    based on an unprecedented amount of coding sequences taken from 218 genes
    resulted in a highly supported tree placing the root of Placentalia
    between Afrotheria and Exafroplacentalia (Afrotheria hypothesis). This
    topology was validated by the phylogenetic analysis of a new class of
    genomic phylogenetic markers, the conserved noncoding sequences. Applying
    the tests of alternative topologies on the coding sequence dataset
    resulted in the rejection of the Atlantogenata hypothesis (Xenarthra
    grouping with Afrotheria), while this test rejected the second
    alternative scenario, the Epitheria hypothesis (Xenarthra at the base),
    when using the noncoding sequence dataset. Thus, the two datasets support
    the Afrotheria hypothesis; however, none can reject both of the remaining
    topological alternatives.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Detecting recent selected 'genomic footprints'
    applies directly to the discovery of disease genes and in the imputation
    of the formative events that molded modern population genetic structure.
    The imprints of historic selection/adaptation episodes left in human and
    animal genomes allow one to interpret modern and ancestral gene origins
    and modifications. Current approaches to reveal selected regions applied
    in genome-wide selection scans (GWSSs) fall into eight principal
    categories: (I) phylogenetic footprinting, (II) detecting increased rates
    of functional mutations, (III) evaluating divergence versus polymorphism,
    (IV) detecting extended segments of linkage disequilibrium, (V)
    evaluating local reduction in genetic variation, (VI) detecting changes
    in the shape of the frequency distribution (spectrum) of genetic
    variation, (VII) assessing differentiating between populations (F(ST)),
    and (VIII) detecting excess or decrease in admixture contribution from
    one population. Here, we review and compare these approaches using
    available human genome-wide datasets to provide independent verification
    (or not) of regions found by different methods and using different
    populations. The lessons learned from GWSSs will be applied to identify
    genome signatures of historic selective pressures on genes and gene
    regions in other species with emerging genome sequences. This would offer
    considerable potential for genome annotation in functional, developmental
    and evolutionary contexts.>

    selection was detected in 77\\% of 884 genes studied. Most positive
    selection concerns a few sites on a single branch of the phylogenetic
    tree: Between 0.9\\% and 4.7\\% of sites are affected by positive
    selection depending on the branches. No functional category was
    overrepresented among genes under positive selection. Surprisingly, whole
    genome duplication had no effect on the prevalence of positive selection,
    whether the fish-specific genome duplication or the two rounds at the
    origin of vertebrates. Thus positive selection has not been limited to a
    few gene classes, or to specific evolutionary events such as duplication,

    <bib-field|abstract|The genus Drosophila is diverse and heterogeneous and
    contains a large number of easy-to-rear species, so it is an attractive
    subject for comparative studies. The ability to perform such studies is
    currently compromised by the lack of a comprehensive phylogeny for
    Drosophila and related genera. The genus Drosophila as currently defined
    is known to be paraphyletic with respect to several other genera, but
    considerable uncertainty remains about other aspects of the phylogeny.
    Here, we estimate a phylogeny for 176 drosophilid (12 genera) and four
    non-drosophilid species, using gene sequences for up to 13 different
    genes per species (average: 4333 bp, five genes per species). This is the
    most extensive set of molecular data on drosophilids yet analysed.
    Phylogenetic analyses were conducted with maximum-likelihood (ML) and
    Bayesian approaches. Our analysis confirms that the genus Drosophila is
    paraphyletic with 100\\% support in the Bayesian analysis and 90\\%
    bootstrap support in the ML analysis. The subgenus Sophophora, which
    includes Drosophila melanogaster, is the sister clade of all the other
    subgenera as well as of most species of six other genera. This sister
    clade contains two large, well-supported subclades. The first subclade
    contains the Hawaiian Drosophila, the genus Scaptomyza, and the
    virilis-repleta radiation. The second contains the immigrans-tripunctata
    radiation as well as the genera Hirtodrosophila (except Hirtodrosophila
    duncani), Mycodrosophila, Zaprionus and Liodrosophila. We argue that
    these results support a taxonomic revision of the genus Drosophila.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Seminal fluid proteins show striking effects on
    reproduction, involving manipulation of female behavior and physiology,
    mechanisms of sperm competition, and pathogen defense. Strong adaptive
    pressures are expected for such manifestations of sexual selection and
    host defense, but the extent of positive selection in seminal fluid
    proteins from divergent taxa is unknown. We identified adaptive evolution
    in primate seminal proteins using genomic resources in a tissue-specific
    study. We found extensive signatures of positive selection when comparing
    161 human seminal fluid proteins and 2,858 prostate-expressed genes to
    those in chimpanzee. Seven of eight outstanding genes yielded
    statistically significant evidence of positive selection when analyzed in
    divergent primates. Functional clues were gained through divergent
    analysis, including several cases of species-specific loss of function in
    copulatory plug genes, and statistically significant spatial clustering
    of positively selected sites near the active site of kallikrein 2. This
    study reveals previously unidentified positive selection in seven primate
    seminal proteins, and when considered with findings in Drosophila,
    indicates that extensive positive selection is found in seminal fluid
    across divergent taxonomic groups.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network has a
    small number of highly connected protein nodes (known as hubs) and many
    poorly connected nodes. Genome-wide studies show that deletion of a hub
    protein is more likely to be lethal than deletion of a non-hub protein, a
    phenomenon known as the centrality-lethality rule. This rule is widely
    believed to reflect the special importance of hubs in organizing the
    network, which in turn suggests the biological significance of network
    architectures, a key notion of systems biology. Despite the popularity of
    this explanation, the underlying cause of the centrality-lethality rule
    has never been critically examined. We here propose the concept of
    essential PPIs, which are PPIs that are indispensable for the survival or
    reproduction of an organism. Our network analysis suggests that the
    centrality-lethality rule is unrelated to the network architecture, but
    is explained by the simple fact that hubs have large numbers of PPIs,
    therefore high probabilities of engaging in essential PPIs. We estimate
    that approximately 3\\% of PPIs are essential in the yeast, accounting
    for approximately 43\\% of essential genes. As expected, essential PPIs
    are evolutionarily more conserved than nonessential PPIs. Considering the
    role of essential PPIs in determining gene essentiality, we find the
    yeast PPI network functionally more robust than random networks, yet far
    less robust than the potential optimum. These and other findings provide
    new perspectives on the biological relevance of network structure and
    robustness.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Chromosome aberrations, in particular translocations
    and their corresponding gene fusions, have an important role in the
    initial steps of tumorigenesis; at present, 358 gene fusions involving
    337 different genes have been identified. An increasing number of gene
    fusions are being recognized as important diagnostic and prognostic
    parameters in malignant haematological disorders and childhood sarcomas.
    The biological and clinical impact of gene fusions in the more common
    solid tumour types has been less appreciated. However, an analysis of
    available data shows that gene fusions occur in all malignancies, and
    that they account for 20\\% of human cancer morbidity. With the advent of
    new and powerful investigative tools that enable the detection of
    cytogenetically cryptic rearrangements, this proportion is likely to
    increase substantially.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The evolution of duplicate genes has been a topic of
    broad interest. Here we propose that the conservation of gene family size
    is a good indicator of the rate of sequence evolution and some other
    biological properties. By comparing the human-chimpanzee-macaque
    orthologous gene families with and without family size conservation, we
    demonstrate that genes of family-size-conserved families evolve more
    slowly than those of non-family-size-conserved families. Our results
    further demonstrate that both family expansion and contraction events may
    accelerate gene evolution, resulting in elevated evolutionary rates in
    the non-family-size-conserved families. In addition, we show that the
    duplicate genes with family size conservation evolve significantly more
    slowly than those without family size conservation. Interestingly, the
    median evolutionary rate of singletons falls in between those of the
    above two types of duplicate gene families. Our results thus suggest that
    the controversy on whether duplicate genes evolve more slowly than
    singletons can be resolved when family size conservation is taken into
    consideration. Furthermore, we also observe that duplicate genes with
    family size conservation have the highest level of gene
    expression/expression breadth, the highest proportion of essential genes
    and the lowest gene compactness, followed by singletons, and then by
    duplicate genes without family size conservation. Such a trend accords
    well with our observations of evolutionary rates. Our results thus point
    to the importance of family size conservation in the evolution of
    duplicate genes.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The most remarkable outcome of a gene duplication
    event is the evolution of a novel function. Little information exists on
    how the rise of a novel function affects the evolution of its paralogous
    sister gene copy, however. We studied the evolution of the feminizer
    (fem) gene from which the gene complementary sex determiner (csd)
    recently derived by tandem duplication within the honey bee (Apis)
    lineage. Previous studies showed that fem retained its sex determination
    function, whereas the rise of csd established a new primary signal of sex
    determination. We observed a specific reduction of nonsynonymous to
    synonymous substitution ratios in Apis to non-Apis fem. We found a
    contrasting pattern at two other genetically linked genes, suggesting
    that hitchhiking effects to csd, the locus under balancing selection, is
    not the cause of this evolutionary pattern. We also excluded higher
    synonymous substitution rates by relative rate testing. These results
    imply that stronger purifying selection is operating at the fem gene in
    the presence of csd. We propose that csd's new function interferes with
    the function of Fem protein, resulting in molecular constraints and
    limited evolvability of fem in the Apis lineage. Elevated silent
    nucleotide polymorphism in fem relative to the genome-wide average
    suggests that genetic linkage to the csd gene maintained more nucleotide
    variation in today's population. Our findings provide evidence that csd
    functionally and genetically interferes with fem, suggesting that a newly
    evolved gene and its functions can limit the evolutionary capability of
    other genes in the genome.>

    <bib-field|abstract|10.1073/pnas.0404380101 Most Mendelian diseases
    studied to date arise from mutations that lead to a single amino acid
    change in an encoded protein. An increasing number of complex diseases
    have also been associated with amino acid-changing single-nucleotide
    polymorphisms (coding SNPs, cSNPs), suggesting potential similarities
    between Mendelian and complex diseases at the molecular level. Here, we
    use two different evolutionary analyses to compare Mendelian and complex
    disease-associated cSNPs. In the first, we estimate the likelihood that a
    specific amino acid substitution in a protein will affect the protein's
    function, by using amino acid substitution scores derived from an
    alignment of related protein sequences and statistics from hidden Markov
    models. In the second, we use standard Ka/Ks ratios to make comparisons
    at the gene, rather than the individual amino acid, level. We find that
    Mendelian disease cSNPs have a very strong tendency to occur at highly
    conserved amino acid positions in proteins, suggesting that they
    generally have a severe impact on the function of the protein. Perhaps
    surprisingly, the distribution of amino acid substitution scores for
    complex disease cSNPs is dramatically different from the distribution for
    Mendelian disease cSNPs, and is indistinguishable from the distribution
    for \\^{a}normal\\^{a} human variation. Further, the
    distributions of Ka/Ks ratios for human and mouse orthologs indicate
    greater positive selection (or less negative selection) pressure on
    complex disease-associated genes, on average. These findings suggest that
    caution should be exercised when using Mendelian disease as a model for
    complex disease, at least with respect to molecular effects on protein
    function.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Much has been written of the early history of
    comparative embryology and its influence on the emergence of an
    evolutionary developmental perspective. However, this literature, which
    dates back nearly a century, has been focused on metazoans, without
    acknowledgment of the contributions of comparative plant morphologists to
    the creation of a developmental view of biodiversity. We trace the origin
    of comparative plant developmental morphology from its inception in the
    eighteenth century works of Wolff and Goethe, through the mid nineteenth
    century discoveries of the general principles of leaf and floral organ
    morphogenesis. Much like the stimulus that von Baer provided as a
    nonevolutionary comparative embryologist to the creation of an
    evolutionary developmental view of animals, the comparative developmental
    studies of plant morphologists were the basis for the first articulation
    of the concept that plant (namely floral) evolution results from
    successive modifications of ontogeny. Perhaps most surprisingly, we show
    that the first person to carefully read and internalize the remarkable
    advances in the understanding of plant morphogenesis in the 1840s and
    1850s is none other than Charles Darwin, whose notebooks, correspondence,
    and (then) unpublished manuscripts clearly demonstrate that he had
    discovered the developmental basis for the evolutionary transformation of
    plant form.>

    in mature sperm was found to be continuously variable from 0 to nearly
    80\\%. These results show that P1 and P2 do not interact with each other
    or DNA to form a discrete complex or subunit structure that is dependent
    upon particular P1/P2 stoichiometries. Data obtained from a number of
    closely and distantly related species also indicate that while the P2
    content of sperm chromatin is allowed to vary over a wide range during
    the course of evolution, the relative proportion of P1 and P2 are tightly
    regulated within a genus.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Sperm competition involves competition between the
    gametes of two or more males of a species for fertilization of a given
    set of ova. Sperm competition is widespread among mammals, as in many
    other groups of vertebrates. Effects of sexual selection, via sperm
    competition, upon the evolution of reproductive physiology and behavior
    are much better understood in invertebrates (and especially in insects)
    than is the case for mammals. However, if the reproductive organs of male
    mammals are viewed as an integrated system for production and delivery of
    spermatozoa (and accessory glandular secretions) to females, then it is
    logical to assume that sperm competition might influence the evolution of
    all parts of the system, as well as associated physiological mechanisms
    (e.g., testicular endocrinology) and behavior (e.g., copulatory
    patterns). Here we analyze and review relationships between mating
    systems, relative testes sizes and sperm morphology, phallic morphology,
    circulating testosterone levels and sexual behavior in male mammals.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The independent evolution of morphological
    similarities is widespread. For simple traits, such as overall body
    colour, repeated transitions by means of mutations in the same gene may
    be common. However, for more complex traits, the possible genetic paths
    may be more numerous; the molecular mechanisms underlying their
    independent origins and the extent to which they are constrained to
    follow certain genetic paths are largely unknown. Here we show that a
    male wing pigmentation pattern involved in courtship display has been
    gained and lost multiple times in a Drosophila clade. Each of the cases
    we have analysed (two gains and two losses) involved regulatory changes
    at the pleiotropic pigmentation gene yellow. Losses involved the parallel
    inactivation of the same cis-regulatory element (CRE), with changes at a
    few nucleotides sufficient to account for the functional divergence of
    one element between two sibling species. Surprisingly, two independent
    gains of wing spots resulted from the co-option of distinct ancestral
    CREs. These results demonstrate how the functional diversification of the
    modular CREs of pleiotropic genes contributes to evolutionary novelty and
    the independent evolution of morphological similarities.>

    <bib-field|abstract|An elevated rate of substitution characterizes the
    molecular evolution of reproductive proteins from a wide range of taxa.
    Although the selective pressures explaining this rapid evolution are yet
    to be resolved, recent evidence implicates sexual selection as a
    potentially important explanatory factor. To investigate this hypothesis,
    we sought evidence of a high rate of adaptive gene evolution linked to
    postcopulatory sexual selection in muroid rodents, a model vertebrate
    group displaying a broad range of mating systems. Specifically, we
    sequenced 7 genes from diverse rodents that are expressed in the testes,
    prostate, or seminal vesicles, products of which have the potential to
    act in sperm competition. We inferred positive Darwinian selection in
    these genes by estimation of the ratio of nonsynonymous (d(N), amino acid
    changing) to synonymous (d(S), amino acid retaining) substitution rates
    (omega = d(N)/d(S)). Next, we tested whether variation in this ratio
    among lineages could be attributed to interspecific variation in mating
    systems, as inferred from the variation in these rodents' relative testis
    sizes (RTS). Four of the 7 genes examined (Prm1, Sva, Acrv1, and Svs2,
    but not Svp2, Msmb, or Spink3) exhibit unambiguous evidence of positive
    selection. One of these, the seminal vesicle-derived protein Svs2, also
    shows some evidence for a concentration of positive selection in those
    lineages in which sperm competition is common. However, this was not a
    general trend among all the rodent genes we examined. Using the same
    methods, we then reanalyzed previously published data on 2 primate genes,
    SEMG1 and SEMG2. Although SEMG2 also shows evidence of positive selection
    concentrated in lineages subject to high levels of sperm competition, no
    such trend was found for SEMG1. Overall, despite a high rate of positive
    selection being a feature of many ejaculate proteins, these results
    indicate that the action of sexual selection potentially responsible for
    elevated evolutionary rates may be difficult to detect on a gene-by-gene
    basis. Although the extreme diversity of reproductive phenotypes
    exhibited in nature attests to the power of sexual selection, the extent
    to which this force predominates in driving the rapid molecular evolution
    of reproductive genes therefore remains to be determined.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The duplication of genes and even complete genomes
    may be a prerequisite for major evolutionary transitions and the origin
    of evolutionary novelties. However, the evolutionary mechanisms of gene
    evolution and the origin of novel gene functions after gene duplication
    have been a subject of many debates. Recently, we compiled 26 groups of
    orthologous genes, which included one gene from human, mouse, and
    chicken, one or two genes from the tetraploid Xenopus and two genes from
    zebrafish. Comparative analysis and mapping data showed that these pairs
    of zebrafish genes were probably produced during a fish-specific genome
    duplication that occurred between 300 and 450 Mya, before the teleost
    radiation (Taylor et al. 2001). As discussed here, many of these retained
    duplicated genes code for DNA binding proteins. Different models have
    been developed to explain the retention of duplicated genes and in
    particular the subfunctionalization model of Force et al. (1999) could
    explain why so many developmental control genes have been retained. Other
    models are harder to reconcile with this particular set of duplicated
    genes. Most genes seem to have been subjected to strong purifying
    selection, keeping properties such as charge and polarity the same in
    both duplicates, although some evidence was found for positive Darwinian
    selection, in particular for Hox genes. However, since only the
    cumulative pattern of nucleotide substitutions can be studied, clear
    indications of positive Darwinian selection or neutrality may be hard to
    find for such anciently duplicated genes. Nevertheless, an increase in
    evolutionary rate in about half of the duplicated genes seems to suggest
    that either positive Darwinian selection has occurred or that functional
    constraints have been relaxed at one point in time during functional
    divergence.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Bi-directional BLAST is a simple approach to detect,
    annotate, and analyze candidate orthologous or paralogous sequences in a
    single go. This procedure is usually confined to the realm of customized
    Perl scripts, usually tuned for UNIX-like environments. Porting those
    scripts to other operating systems involves refactoring them, and also
    the installation of the Perl programming environment with the required
    libraries. To overcome these limitations, a data pipeline was implemented
    in Java. This application submits two batches of sequences to local
    versions of the NCBI BLAST tool, manages result lists, and refines both
    bi-directional and simple hits. GO Slim terms are attached to hits,
    several statistics are derived, and molecular evolution rates are
    estimated through PAML. The results are written to a set of delimited
    text tables intended for further analysis. The provided graphic user
    interface allows a friendly interaction with this application, which is
    documented and available to download at

    <bib-field|abstract|MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs of 19-24
    nucleotides in length that downregulate gene expression during various
    crucial cell processes such as apoptosis, differentiation and
    development. Recent work supports a role for miRNAs in the initiation and
    progression of human malignancies. Large high-throughput studies in
    patients revealed that miRNA profiling have the potential to classify
    tumors with high accuracy and predict outcome. Functional studies, some
    of which involve animal models, indicate that miRNAs act as tumor
    suppressors and oncogenes. Here, we summarize miRNA-profiling studies in
    human malignancies and examine the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of
    cancer. We also discuss the implications of these findings for the
    diagnosis and treatment of cancer.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Phylemon 2.0 is the second release of the suite of
    web-tools for molecular evolution, phylogenetics and phylogenomics
    previously published in 2007 (NAR 35:W38-42). The new web server
    integrates a suite of more than 30 different tools for phylogenetic and
    evolutionary analyses. It is conceived as a natural response to the
    increasing demand of data analysis in many different practical courses on
    phylogeny as well as labs of experimental scientists willing to add a
    molecular evolution and phylogenetics insight into their research using
    the more classical tools and the new developments in the area. In this
    context we launch Phylemon 2.0 with new tools and utilities such as
    TrimAl, ReadAl, Lagan, Mlagan, jModelTest and HyPhy tools to test for
    molecular adaptation considering synonymous rate variation across sites.
    All these tools are integrated in its main blocks: utilities, alignment,
    phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary tests. Phylemon 2.0 has been
    completely re-engineered and now it is based on AJAX's Web 2.0 technology
    features. This has facilitated the design of a new interface that allows
    asynchronous use, as well as projects, jobs and user management. The
    tools and utilities included in Phylemon 2.0 range from file format
    conversion (ReadAl), multiple sequence alignments (ClustalW, Muscle,
    Lagan and Mlagan), alignment edition (TrimAl), basic algorithms of
    distance and parsimony methods (Phylip programs), to more complex maximum
    likelihood (PhyML, jModelTest) and Bayesian methods (MrBayes) for
    phylogenetic reconstruction. Moreover, Phylemon 2.0 provides evolutionary
    tests to search for the best evolutionary model explaining DNA
    (ModelTest) and protein (Protest) sequences data under the HyPhy
    environment; relative rate tests (RRTree); tests of positive selection by
    means of branch, site and branch-site models of PAML (CodeML); the
    site-wise likelihood ratio test (SLR) for detection of sites under
    positive and negative selection, and the new HyPhy developments for
    adaptive evolution considering synonymous rate (dS) variation across
    sites. All tools are integrated in a shared user friendly web-environment
    with infile examples to run and the help files in all programs. Phylemon
    2.0 can manage hundreds of independent input and output files for a
    phylogenomic analysis. In this case, fully automatic and basic
    phylogenomic analyses can be executed by defining pipelines through a
    modular design environment implemented in a Java applet. Phylemon 2.0 is
    a useful integrated web-server implementing classical and more advanced
    statistical evolutionary analyses for phylogenetic, phylogenomics and
    evolutionary hypothesis testing.>

    <bib-field|abstract|It is possible to estimate the proportion of
    substitutions that are due to adaptive evolution using the numbers of
    silent and nonsilent polymorphisms and substitutions in a McDonald and
    Kreitman-type analysis. Unfortunately, this estimate of adaptive
    evolution is biased downward by the segregation of slightly deleterious
    mutations. It has been suggested that 1 way to cope with the effects of
    these slightly deleterious mutations is to remove low-frequency
    polymorphisms from the analysis. We investigate the performance of this
    method theoretically. We show that although removing low-frequency
    polymorphisms does indeed reduce the bias in the estimate of adaptive
    evolution, the estimate is always downwardly biased, often to the extent
    that one would not be able to detect adaptive evolution, even if it
    existed. The method is reasonably satisfactory, only if the rate of
    adaptive evolution is high and the distribution of fitness effects for
    slightly deleterious mutations is very leptokurtic. Our analysis suggests
    that adaptive evolution could be quite prevalent in humans (\>8\\%) and
    still not be detectable using current methodologies. Our analysis also
    suggests that the level of adaptive evolution has probably been
    underestimated, possibly substantially, in both bacteria and Drosophila.>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: Understanding the constraints that
    operate in mammalian gene promoter sequences is of key importance to
    understand the evolution of gene regulatory networks. The level of
    promoter conservation varies greatly across orthologous genes, denoting
    differences in the strength of the evolutionary constraints. Here we test
    the hypothesis that the number of tissues in which a gene is expressed is
    related in a significant manner to the extent of promoter sequence
    conservation. RESULTS: We show that mammalian housekeeping genes,
    expressed in all or nearly all tissues, show significantly lower promoter
    sequence conservation, especially upstream of position -500 with respect
    to the transcription start site, than genes expressed in a subset of
    tissues. In addition, we evaluate the effect of gene function, CpG island
    content and protein evolutionary rate on promoter sequence conservation.
    Finally, we identify a subset of transcription factors that bind to
    motifs that are specifically over-represented in housekeeping gene
    promoters. CONCLUSION: This is the first report that shows that the
    promoters of housekeeping genes show reduced sequence conservation with
    respect to genes expressed in a more tissue-restricted manner. This is
    likely to be related to simpler gene expression, requiring a smaller
    number of functional cis-regulatory motifs.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Physically interacting proteins or parts of proteins
    are expected to evolve in a coordinated manner that preserves proper
    interactions. Such coevolution at the amino acid-sequence level is well
    documented and has been used to predict interacting proteins, domains,
    and amino acids. Interacting proteins are also often precisely
    coexpressed with one another, presumably to maintain proper stoichiometry
    among interacting components. Here, we show that the expression levels of
    physically interacting proteins coevolve. We estimate average expression
    levels of genes from four closely related fungi of the genus
    Saccharomyces using the codon adaptation index and show that expression
    levels of interacting proteins exhibit coordinated changes in these
    different species. We find that this coevolution of expression is a more
    powerful predictor of physical interaction than is coevolution of amino
    acid sequence. These results demonstrate that gene expression levels can
    coevolve, adding another dimension to the study of the coevolution of
    interacting proteins and underscoring the importance of maintaining
    coexpression of interacting proteins over evolutionary time. Our results
    also suggest that expression coevolution can be used for computational
    prediction of protein-protein interactions.>

    <bib-field|abstract|While the concept of a gene has been helpful in
    defining the relationship of a portion of a genome to a phenotype, this
    traditional term may not be as useful as it once was. Currently, "gene"
    has come to refer principally to a genomic region producing a
    polyadenylated mRNA that encodes a protein. However, the recent emergence
    of a large collection of unannotated transcripts with apparently little
    protein coding capacity, collectively called transcripts of unknown
    function (TUFs), has begun to blur the physical boundaries and genomic
    organization of genic regions with noncoding transcripts often
    overlapping protein-coding genes on the same (sense) and opposite strand
    (antisense). Moreover, they are often located in intergenic regions,
    making the genic portions of the human genome an interleaved network of
    both annotated polyadenylated and nonpolyadenylated transcripts,
    including splice variants with novel 5' ends extending hundreds of
    kilobases. This complex transcriptional organization and other recently
    observed features of genomes argue for the reconsideration of the term
    "gene" and suggests that transcripts may be used to define the
    operational unit of a genome.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Protamines are the major nuclear sperm proteins. The
    human sperm nucleus contains two types of protamine: protamine 1 (P1)
    encoded by a single-copy gene and the family of protamine 2 (P2) proteins
    (P2, P3 and P4), all also encoded by a single gene that is transcribed
    and translated into a precursor protein. The protamines were discovered
    more than a century ago, but their function is not yet fully understood.
    In fact, different hypotheses have been proposed: condensation of the
    sperm nucleus into a compact hydrodynamic shape, protection of the
    genetic message delivered by the spermatozoa, involvement in the
    processes maintaining the integrity and repair of DNA during or after the
    nucleohistone-nucleoprotamine transition and involvement in the
    epigenetic imprinting of the spermatozoa. Protamines are also one of the
    most variable proteins found in nature, with data supporting a positive
    Darwinian selection. Changes in the expression of P1 and P2 protamines
    have been found to be associated with infertility in man. Mutations in
    the protamine genes have also been found in some infertile patients.
    Transgenic mice defective in the expression of protamines also present
    several structural defects in the sperm nucleus and have variable degrees
    of infertility. There is also evidence that altered levels of protamines

    <bib-field|abstract|The majority of metazoan genomes consist of
    nonprotein-coding regions, although the functional significance of most
    noncoding DNA sequences remains unknown. Highly conserved noncoding
    sequences (CNSs) have proven to be reliable indicators of functionally
    constrained sequences such as cis-regulatory elements and noncoding RNA
    genes. However, CNSs may arise from nonselective evolutionary processes
    such as genomic regions with extremely low mutation rates known as
    mutation "cold spots." Here we combine comparative genomic data from
    recently completed insect genome projects with population genetic data in
    Drosophila melanogaster to test predictions of the mutational cold spot
    model of CNS evolution in the genus Drosophila. We find that point
    mutations in intronic and intergenic CNSs exhibit a significant reduction
    in levels of divergence relative to levels of polymorphism, as well as a
    significant excess of rare derived alleles, compared with either the
    nonconserved spacer regions between CNSs or with 4-fold silent sites in
    coding regions. Controlling for the effects of purifying selection, we
    find no evidence of positive selection acting on Drosophila CNSs,
    although we do find evidence for the action of recurrent positive
    selection in the spacer regions between CNSs. We estimate that
    approximately 85\\% of sites in Drosophila CNSs are under constraint with
    selection coefficients (N(e)s) on the order of 10-100, and thus, the
    estimated strength and number of sites under purifying selection is
    greater for Drosophila CNSs relative to those in the human genome. These
    patterns of nonneutral molecular evolution are incompatible with the
    mutational cold spot hypothesis to explain the existence of CNSs in
    Drosophila and, coupled with similar findings in mammals, argue against
    the general likelihood that CNSs are generated by mutational cold spots
    in any metazoan genome.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Male reproductive fitness is strongly affected by
    seminal fluid. In addition to interacting with the female environment,
    seminal fluid mediates important physiological characteristics of sperm,
    including capacitation and motility. In mammals, the male reproductive
    tract shows a striking degree of compartmentalization, with at least six
    distinct tissue types contributing material that is combined with sperm
    in an ejaculate. Although studies of whole ejaculates have been
    undertaken in some species, we lack a comprehensive picture of the
    specific proteins produced by different accessory tissues. Here, we
    perform proteomic investigations of six regions of the male reproductive
    tract in mice -- seminal vesicles, anterior prostate, dorsolateral
    prostate, ventral prostate, bulbourethral gland, and bulbourethral
    diverticulum. We identify 766 proteins that could be mapped to 506 unique
    genes and compare them with a high-quality human seminal fluid data set.
    We find that Gene Ontology functions of seminal proteins are largely
    conserved between mice and humans. By placing these data in an
    evolutionary framework, we show that seminal vesicle proteins have
    experienced a significantly higher rate of nonsynonymous substitution
    compared with the genome, which could be the result of adaptive
    evolution. In contrast, proteins from the other five tissues showed
    significantly lower nonsynonymous substitution, revealing a previously
    unappreciated level of evolutionary constraint acting on the majority of
    male reproductive proteins.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The function of the cysteine-containing spermatidal
    proteins and of protamine in the packaging and stabilization of chromatin
    during ram spermiogenesis was investigated. Extractions of the histones
    and spermatidal proteins from the nonround spermatid nuclei decreases the
    nuclear stability (sonication resistance), decondenses the chromatin, and
    reduces the diameter of the largest chromatin threads (100-200 A vs. 380
    A in the control nuclei). Extractions by acid, salt, or heparin have no
    effect on the protamine-containing electron-opaque chromatin. In
    contrast, treatment by dithiothreitol alone decondenses all the nonround
    spermatid nuclei at a rate which decreases with the maturation state of
    the nuclei. The electron-opaque chromatin is then resolved in 35-A-thick
    filaments. Experimentally induced fluctuations of the level of SS bonding
    appear to influence the chromatin stabilization and ultrastructure in
    most of the nonround spermatid nuclei. These data evidence that
    noncovalent interactions play a main structural role at the beginning of
    chromatin reorganization, and SS bonding between spermatidal proteins and
    then between protamine molecules increases progressively and becomes
    mainly responsible for the chromatin stabilization in the
    protamine-containing nuclei.>

    <bib-field|abstract|It is well known that young proteins tend to
    experience weaker purifying selection and evolve more quickly than old
    proteins. Here, we show that, in addition, young proteins tend to
    experience more variable selection pressures over time than old proteins.
    We demonstrate this pattern in three independent taxonomic groups: yeast,
    Drosophila, and mammals. The increased variability of selection pressures
    on young proteins is highly significant even after controlling for the
    fact that young proteins are typically shorter and experience weaker
    purifying selection than old proteins. The majority of our results are
    consistent with the hypothesis that the function of a young gene tends to
    change over time more readily than that of an old gene. At the same time,
    our results may be caused in part by young genes that serve constant
    functions over time, but nevertheless appear to evolve under changing
    selection pressures due to depletion of adaptive mutations. In either
    case, our results imply that the evolution of a protein-coding sequence
    is partly determined by its age and origin, and not only by the
    phenotypic properties of the encoded protein. We discuss, via specific
    examples, the consequences of these findings for understanding of the
    sources of evolutionary novelty.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Research in quantitative evolutionary genomics and
    systems biology led to the discovery of several universal regularities
    connecting genomic and molecular phenomic variables. These universals
    include the log-normal distribution of the evolutionary rates of
    orthologous genes; the power law-like distributions of paralogous family
    size and node degree in various biological networks; the negative
    correlation between a gene's sequence evolution rate and expression
    level; and differential scaling of functional classes of genes with
    genome size. The universals of genome evolution can be accounted for by
    simple mathematical models similar to those used in statistical physics,
    such as the birth-death-innovation model. These models do not explicitly
    incorporate selection; therefore, the observed universal regularities do
    not appear to be shaped by selection but rather are emergent properties
    of gene ensembles. Although a complete physical theory of evolutionary
    biology is inconceivable, the universals of genome evolution might
    qualify as "laws of evolutionary genomics" in the same sense "law" is
    understood in modern physics.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The screening of many endpoints when comparing groups
    from different strains, searching for some statistically significant
    difference, raises the multiple comparisons problem in its most severe
    form. Using the 0.05 level to decide which of the many endpoints'
    differences are statistically significant, the probability of finding a
    difference to be significant even though it is not real increases far
    beyond 0.05. The traditional approach to this problem has been to control
    the probability of making even one such error–the Bonferroni procedure
    being the most familiar procedure achieving such control. However, the
    incurred loss of power stemming from such control led many practitioners
    to neglect multiplicity control altogether. The False Discovery Rate
    (FDR), suggested by Benjamini and Hochberg [J Royal Stat Soc Ser B 57
    (1995) 289], is a new, different, and compromising point of view
    regarding the error in multiple comparisons. The FDR is the expected
    proportion of false discoveries among the discoveries, and controlling
    the FDR goes a long way towards controlling the increased error from
    multiplicity while losing less in the ability to discover real
    differences. In this paper we demonstrate the problem in two studies: the
    study of exploratory behavior [Behav Brain Res (2001)], and the study of
    the interaction of strain differences with laboratory environment
    [Science 284 (1999) 1670]. We explain the FDR criterion, and present two
    simple procedures that control the FDR. We demonstrate their increased
    power when used in the above two studies.>

    <bib-field|abstract|In the rodent superfamily Muroidea, a model for the
    evolution of sperm form has been proposed in which it is suggested that a
    hook-shaped sperm head and long tail evolved from a more simple,
    nonhooked head and short tail in several different subfamilies. To test
    this model the shape of the sperm head, with particular emphasis on its
    apical region, and length of sperm tail were matched to a recent
    phylogeny based on the nucleotide sequence of several protein-coding
    nuclear genes from 3 families and 10 subfamilies of muroid rodents. Data
    from the two other myomorph superfamilies, the Dipodoidea and kangaroo
    rats in the Geomyoidea, were used for an outgroup comparison. In most
    species in all 10 muroid subfamilies, apart from in the Murinae, the
    sperm head has a long rostral hook largely composed of acrosomal
    material, although its length and cross-sectional shape vary across the
    various subfamilies. Nevertheless, in a few species of various lineages a
    very different sperm morphology occurs in which an apical hook is
    lacking. In the outgroups the three species of dipodid rodents have a
    sperm head that lacks a hook, whereas in the heteromyids an
    acrosome-containing apical hook is present. It is concluded that, as the
    hook-shaped sperm head and long sperm tail occur across the muroid
    subfamilies, as well as in the heteromyid rodents, it is likely to be the
    ancestral condition within each of the subfamilies with the various forms
    of nonhooked sperm heads, that are sometimes associated with short tails,
    being highly derived states. These findings thus argue against a repeated
    evolution in various muroid lineages of a complex, hook-shaped sperm head
    and long sperm tail from a more simple, nonhooked sperm head and short
    tail. An alternative proposal for the evolution of sperm form within the
    Muroidea is presented in the light of these data.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Charles Darwin's evolutionary theories of animal
    communication were deeply embedded in a centuries-old model of
    association psychology, whose prodromes have most often been traced to
    the writings of Aristotle. His notions of frequency of occurrence of
    pairings have been passed down through the centuries and were a major
    ontological feature in the formation of associative connectivity. He
    focused on the associations of cause and effect, contiguity of sequential
    occurrence, and similarity among items. Cause and effect were often
    reduced to another type of contiguity relation, so that Aristotle is most
    often evoked as the originator of the associative bondings through
    similarity and contiguity, contiguity being the most powerful and
    frequent means of association. Contiguity eventually became the
    overriding mechanism for serial ordering of mental events in both
    perception and action. The notions of concatenation throughout the
    association psychology took the form of "trains" of events, both sensory
    and motor, in such a way that serial ordering came to be viewed as an
    item-by-item string of locally contiguous events. Modern developments in
    the mathematics of serial ordering have advanced in sophistication since
    the early and middle twentieth century, and new computational methods
    have allowed us to reevaluate the serial concatenative theories of Darwin
    and the associationists. These new models of serial order permit a closer
    comparative scrutiny between human and nonhuman. The present study
    considers Darwin's insistence on a "degree" continuity between human and
    nonhuman animal serial ordering. We will consider a study of starling
    birdsongs and whether the serial ordering of those songs provides
    evidence that they have a syntax that at best differs only in degree and
    not in kind with the computations of human grammatical structures. We
    will argue that they, in fact, show no such thing.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Here we investigate the correlations between coding
    sequence substitutions as a function of their separation along the
    protein sequence. We consider both substitutions between the reference
    genomes of several Drosophilids as well as polymorphisms in a population
    sample of Zimbabwean Drosophila melanogaster. We find that amino acid
    substitutions are "clustered" along the protein sequence, that is, the
    frequency of additional substitutions is strongly enhanced within ≈10
    residues of a first such substitution. No such clustering is observed for
    synonymous substitutions, supporting a "correlation length" associated
    with selection on proteins as the causative mechanism. Clustering is
    stronger between substitutions that arose in the same lineage than it is
    between substitutions that arose in different lineages. We consider
    several possible origins of clustering, concluding that epistasis
    (interactions between amino acids within a protein that affect function)
    and positional heterogeneity in the strength of purifying selection are
    primarily responsible. The role of epistasis is directly supported by the
    tendency of nearby substitutions that arose on the same lineage to
    preserve the total charge of the residues within the correlation length
    and by the preferential cosegregation of neighboring derived alleles in
    our population sample. We interpret the observed length scale of
    clustering as a statistical reflection of the functional locality (or
    modularity) of proteins: amino acids that are near each other on the
    protein backbone are more likely to contribute to, and collaborate
    toward, a common subfunction.>

    <bib-field|abstract|We used network-level conservation between pairs of
    fly (Drosophila melanogaster/D. pseudoobscura) and worm (Caenorhabditis
    elegans/C. briggsae) genomes to detect highly conserved mRNA motifs in 3'
    untranslated regions. Many of these elements are complementary to the 5'
    extremity of known microRNAs (miRNAs), and likely correspond to their
    target sites. We also identify known targets of RNA-binding proteins, and
    many novel sites not yet known to be functional. Coherent sets of genes
    with similar function often bear the same conserved elements, providing
    new insights into their cellular functions. We also show that target
    sites for distinct miRNAs are often simultaneously conserved, suggesting
    combinatorial regulation by multiple miRNAs. A genome-wide search for
    conserved stem-loops, containing complementary sequences to the novel
    sites, revealed many new candidate miRNAs that likely target them. We
    also provide evidence that posttranscriptional networks have undergone
    extensive rewiring across distant phyla, despite strong conservation of

    <bib-field|abstract|A fundamental problem in biology is understanding how
    natural selection has shaped the evolution of gene regulation. Here we
    use SNP genotype data and techniques from population genetics to study an
    entire layer of short, cis-regulatory sites in the human genome.
    MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that
    post-transcriptionally repress mRNA through cis-regulatory sites in 3'
    UTRs. We show that negative selection in humans is stronger on
    computationally predicted conserved miRNA binding sites than on other
    conserved sequence motifs in 3' UTRs, thus providing independent support
    for the target prediction model and explicitly demonstrating the
    contribution of miRNAs to darwinian fitness. Our techniques extend to
    nonconserved miRNA binding sites, and we estimate that 30\\%-50\\% of
    these are functional when the mRNA and miRNA are endogenously
    coexpressed. As we show that polymorphisms in predicted miRNA binding
    sites are likely to be deleterious, they are candidates for causal
    variants of human disease. We believe that our approach can be extended
    to studying other classes of cis-regulatory sites.>

    Perhaps the area in which least is known is how nuclear organization

    arrangements and their dynamic interactions with other nuclear components
    have been boosted by recent technical advances. The emerging view is that
    chromosomes are compartmentalized into discrete territories. The location
    of a gene within a chromosome territory seems to influence its access to
    the machinery responsible for specific nuclear functions, such as

    <bib-field|abstract|We have analysed the accumulated cytogenetic data on
    karyotypic evolution in Ewing tumours (ET) and synovial sarcomas (SS).
    Both tumour types frequently show balanced translocations, t(11;22) and
    t(X;18), respectively, that result in specific fusion genes. The analyses
    revealed +8, +12, +1q, and 16q- as important secondary changes to
    t(11;22) in ET and the imbalances showed a distinct temporal order. By
    principal component analysis, one major karyotypic pathway dominated by
    gains and one minor dominated by losses were identified. The kartyotypic
    evolution pattern in SS was less distinct. Both ET and SS showed a power
    law distribution of the number of acquired aberrations, which in both
    tumour types conformed to a distribution with an exponent equal to 1.
    Similar distributions are frequently found in epithelial tumours. ET and
    SS differ in this respect from other malignancies with balanced
    translocations resulting in fusion genes, which typically show a power
    law distribution of the number of acquired aberrations with exponents
    close to 2. This suggests that chromosome changes in ET and SS may
    develop through mechanisms more similar to those in epithelial tumours
    lacking recurrent balanced rearrangements than in haematological
    malignancies characterised by balanced translocations leading to fusion

    <bib-field|abstract|Detailed studies of individual genes have shown that
    gene expression divergence often results from adaptive evolution of
    regulatory sequence. Genome-wide analyses, however, have yet to unite
    patterns of gene expression with polymorphism and divergence to infer
    population genetic mechanisms underlying expression evolution. Here, we
    combined genomic expression data--analyzed in a phylogenetic
    context--with whole genome light-shotgun sequence data from six
    Drosophila simulans lines and reference sequences from D. melanogaster
    and D. yakuba. These data allowed us to use molecular population genetics
    to test for neutral versus adaptive gene expression divergence on a
    genomic scale. We identified recent and recurrent adaptive evolution
    along the D. simulans lineage by contrasting sequence polymorphism within
    D. simulans to divergence from D. melanogaster and D. yakuba. Genes that
    evolved higher levels of expression in D. simulans have experienced
    adaptive evolution of the associated 3' flanking and amino acid sequence.
    Concomitantly, these genes are also decelerating in their rates of
    protein evolution, which is in agreement with the finding that highly
    expressed genes evolve slowly. Interestingly, adaptive evolution in 5'
    cis-regulatory regions did not correspond strongly with expression
    evolution. Our results provide a genomic view of the intimate link
    between selection acting on a phenotype and associated genic evolution.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Genomic clustering of genes in a pathway is commonly
    found in prokaryotes due to transcriptional operons, but these are not
    present in most eukaryotes. Yet, there might be clustering to a lesser
    extent of pathway members in eukaryotic genomes, that assist coregulation
    of a set of functionally cooperating genes. We analyzed five sequenced
    eukaryotic genomes for clustering of genes assigned to the same pathway
    in the KEGG database. Between 98\\% and 30\\% of the analyzed pathways in
    a genome were found to exhibit significantly higher clustering levels
    than expected by chance. In descending order by the level of clustering,
    the genomes studied were Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens,
    Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Drosophila
    melanogaster. Surprisingly, there is not much agreement between genomes
    in terms of which pathways are most clustered. Only seven of 69 pathways
    found in all species were significantly clustered in all five of them.
    This species-specific pattern of pathway clustering may reflect
    adaptations or evolutionary events unique to a particular lineage. We
    note that although operons are common in C. elegans, only 58\\% of the
    pathways showed significant clustering, which is less than in human.
    Virtually all pathways in S. cerevisiae showed significant clustering.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The synthesis of di-myo-inositol phosphate (DIP), a
    common compatible solute in hyperthermophiles, involves the consecutive
    actions of inositol-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (IPCT) and
    di-myo-inositol phosphate phosphate synthase (DIPPS). In most cases, both
    activities are present in a single gene product, but separate genes are
    also found in a few organisms. Genes for IPCT and DIPPS were found in the
    genomes of 33 organisms, all with thermophilic/hyperthermophilic
    lifestyles. Phylogeny of IPCT/DIPPS revealed an incongruent topology with
    16S RNA phylogeny, thus suggesting horizontal gene transfer. The
    phylogenetic tree of the DIPPS domain was rooted by using
    phosphatidylinositol phosphate synthase sequences as outgroup. The root
    locates at the separation of genomes with fused and split genes. We
    propose that the gene encoding DIPPS was recruited from the biosynthesis
    of phosphatidylinositol. The last DIP‑synthesizing ancestor harboured
    separated genes for IPCT and DIPPS and this architecture was maintained
    in a crenarchaeal lineage, and transferred by horizontal gene transfer to
    hyperthermophilic marine Thermotoga species. It is plausible that the
    driving force for the assembly of genes encoding IPCT and DIPPS in the
    early ancestor is related to the acquired advantage of DIP producers to
    cope with high temperature. This work corroborates the view that Archaea
    were the first hyperthermophilic organisms.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Communication is an indispensable component of animal
    societies, yet many open questions remain regarding the factors affecting
    the evolution and reliability of signalling systems. A potentially
    important factor is the level of genetic relatedness between signallers
    and receivers. To quantitatively explore the role of relatedness in the
    evolution of reliable signals, we conducted artificial evolution over 500
    generations in a system of foraging robots that can emit and perceive
    light signals. By devising a quantitative measure of signal reliability,
    and comparing independently evolving populations differing in
    within-group relatedness, we show a strong positive correlation between
    relatedness and reliability. Unrelated robots produced unreliable
    signals, whereas highly related robots produced signals that reliably
    indicated the location of the food source and thereby increased
    performance. Comparisons across populations also revealed that the
    frequency for signal production-which is often used as a proxy of signal
    reliability in empirical studies on animal communication-is a poor
    predictor of signal reliability and, accordingly, is not consistently
    correlated with group performance. This has important implications for
    our understanding of signal evolution and the empirical tools that are
    used to investigate communication.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Chromosome arm lengths are the critical parameters of
    the human genome. The physical length is required to scale radiation
    hybrid and other maps to megabases. The genetic lengths in males and
    females are required for probabilities of exclusion and synteny, choice
    of well-spaced loci for linkage tests, and comparison with centromeric
    maps based on nondisjunction. Interpolation of new data into a map is
    possible only when the length is known, including the distances from
    centromere and telomeres to the nearest markers. Current evidence on
    physical parameters including the reliable measurements of relative
    lengths from flow cytometry but only a crude estimate of genome size
    (3200 megabases). Evidence on genetic parameters includes chiasma counts
    and linkage maps corrected for failure to sample telomeres, giving an
    autosomal size of 2809 centimorgans in males and 4782 centimorgans in
    females. Estimates of the physical and sex-specific genetic lengths are
    presented for each chromosome arm. Any linkage analysis that yields
    substantially larger estimates raises a suspicion of an inappropriate

    <bib-field|abstract|Positive Darwinian selection on advantageous point
    substitutions has been demonstrated in many genes. We here provide
    empirical evidence, for the first time, that positive selection can also
    act on insertion/deletion (indel) substitutions in the evolution of a
    protein. CATSPER1 is a voltage-gated calcium channel found exclusively in
    the plasma membrane of the mammalian sperm tail and it is essential for
    sperm motility. We determined the DNA sequences of the first exon of the
    CATSPER1 gene from 15 primates, which encodes the intracellular N
    terminus region of approximately equal to 400 aa. These sequences exhibit
    an excessively high frequency of indels. However, all indels have lengths
    that are multiples of 3 nt (3n indels) and do not disrupt the ORF. The
    number of indel substitutions per site per year in CATSPER1 is five to
    eight times the corresponding rates calculated from two large-scale
    primate genomic comparisons, which represent the neutral rate of indel
    substitutions. Moreover, CATSPER1 indels are considerably longer than
    neutral indels. These observations strongly suggest that positive
    selection has been promoting the fixation of indel mutations in CATSPER1
    exon 1. It has been shown in certain ion channels that the length of the
    N terminus region affects the rate of channel inactivation. This finding
    suggests that the selection detected may be related to the regulation of
    the CATSPER1 channel, which can affect sperm motility, an important
    determinant in sperm competition.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The evolution of homologous sequences affected by
    recombination or gene conversion cannot be adequately explained by a
    single phylogenetic tree. Many tree-based methods for sequence analysis,
    for example, those used for detecting sites evolving nonneutrally, have
    been shown to fail if such phylogenetic incongruity is ignored. However,
    it may be possible to propose several phylogenies that can correctly
    model the evolution of nonrecombinant fragments. We propose a model-based
    framework that uses a genetic algorithm to search a multiple-sequence
    alignment for putative recombination break points, quantifies the level
    of support for their locations, and identifies sequences or clades
    involved in putative recombination events. The software implementation
    can be run quickly and efficiently in a distributed computing
    environment, and various components of the methods can be chosen for
    computational expediency or statistical rigor. We evaluate the
    performance of the new method on simulated alignments and on an array of
    published benchmark data sets. Finally, we demonstrate that prescreening
    alignments with our method allows one to analyze recombinant sequences
    for positive selection. 10.1093/molbev/msl051>

    <bib-field|abstract|Computation underlies the organization of cells into
    higher-order structures, for example during development or the spatial
    asso- ciation of bacteria in a biofilm1–3 . Each cell performs a simple
    computational operation, but when combined with cell–cell com-
    munication, intricate patterns emerge. Here we study this process by
    combining a simple genetic circuit with quorum sensing to produce more
    complex computations in space. We construct a simpleNORlogic gate in
    Escherichiacoliby arranging two tandem promoters that function as inputs
    to drive the transcription of a repressor. The repressor inactivates a
    promoter that serves as the output. Individual colonies of E.colicarry
    the sameNORgate, but the inputs and outputs are wired to different
    orthogonal quorum- sensing ‘sender’ and ‘receiver’ devices4,5 .
    The quorum molecules formthe wires between gates. By arranging the
    colonies in different spatial configurations, all possible two-input
    gates are produced, including the difficult XOR and EQUALS functions. The
    response is strong and robust, with 5- to.300-fold changes between the
    ‘on’ and ‘off’ states. This work helps elucidate the design rules
    by which simple logic can be harnessed to produce diverse and complex
    calculations by rewiring communication between cells.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The influence of sperm competition upon sperm size
    has been a controversial issue during the last 20 years which remains
    unresolved for mammals. The hypothesis that, when ejaculates compete with
    rival males, an increase in sperm size would make sperm more competitive
    because it would increase sperm swimming speed, has generated
    contradictory results from both theoretical and empirical studies. In
    addition, the debate has extended to which sperm components should

    <bib-field|abstract|An excess of nonsynonymous substitutions over
    synonymous ones is an important indicator of positive selection at the
    molecular level. A lineage that underwent Darwinian selection may have a
    nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (dN/dS) that is different from those
    of other lineages or greater than one. In this paper, several codon-based
    likelihood models that allow for variable dN/dS ratios among lineages
    were developed. They were then used to construct likelihood ratio tests
    to examine whether the dN/dS ratio is variable among evolutionary
    lineages, whether the ratio for a few lineages of interest is different
    from the background ratio for other lineages in the phylogeny, and
    whether the dN/dS ratio for the lineages of interest is greater than one.
    The tests were applied to the lysozyme genes of 24 primate species. The
    dN/dS ratios were found to differ significantly among lineages,
    indicating that the evolution of primate lysozymes is episodic, which is
    incompatible with the neutral theory. Maximum-likelihood estimates of
    parameters suggested that about nine nonsynonymous and zero synonymous
    nucleotide substitutions occurred in the lineage leading to hominoids,
    and the dN/dS ratio for that lineage is significantly greater than one.
    The corresponding estimates for the lineage ancestral to colobine monkeys
    were nine and one, and the dN/dS ratio for the lineage is not
    significantly greater than one, although it is significantly higher than
    the background ratio. The likelihood analysis thus confirmed most, but
    not all, conclusions Messier and Stewart reached using reconstructed
    ancestral sequences to estimate synonymous and nonsynonymous rates for
    different lineages.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Codon-based substitution models have been widely used
    to identify amino acid sites under positive selection in comparative
    analysis of protein-coding DNA sequences. The nonsynonymous-synonymous
    substitution rate ratio (d(N)/d(S), denoted omega) is used as a measure
    of selective pressure at the protein level, with omega \> 1 indicating
    positive selection. Statistical distributions are used to model the
    variation in omega among sites, allowing a subset of sites to have omega
    \> 1 while the rest of the sequence may be under purifying selection with
    omega \< 1. An empirical Bayes (EB) approach is then used to calculate
    posterior probabilities that a site comes from the site class with omega
    \> 1. Current implementations, however, use the naive EB (NEB) approach
    and fail to account for sampling errors in maximum likelihood estimates
    of model parameters, such as the proportions and omega ratios for the
    site classes. In small data sets lacking information, this approach may
    lead to unreliable posterior probability calculations. In this paper, we
    develop a Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) approach to the problem, which
    assigns a prior to the model parameters and integrates over their
    uncertainties. We compare the new and old methods on real and simulated
    data sets. The results suggest that in small data sets the new BEB method
    does not generate false positives as did the old NEB approach, while in
    large data sets it retains the good power of the NEB approach for
    inferring positively selected sites.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and long-tailed
    macaque (Macaca fascicularis) are the 2 most commonly used primate model
    species in biomedical sciences. Although morphological studies have
    revealed a weak hybridization at the interspecific contact zone, in the
    north of Indochina, a molecular study has suggested an ancient
    introgression from rhesus to long-tailed macaque into the Indo-Chinese
    peninsula. However, the gene flow between these 2 taxa has never been
    quantified using genetic data and theoretical models. In this study, we
    have examined genetic variation within and between the parapatric Chinese
    rhesus macaque and Indo-Chinese long-tailed macaque populations, using 13
    autosomal, 5 sex-linked microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA
    sequence data. From these data, we assessed genetic structure and
    estimated gene flow using a Bayesian clustering approach and the
    "Isolation with Migration" model. Our results reveal a weak interspecific
    genetic differentiation at both autosomal and sex-linked loci, suggesting
    large population sizes and/or gene flow between populations. According to
    the Bayesian clustering, Chinese rhesus macaque is a highly homogeneous
    gene pool that contributes strongly to the current Indo-Chinese
    long-tailed macaque genetic makeup, whether or not current admixture is
    assumed. Coalescent simulations, which integrated the characteristics of
    the loci, pointed out 1) a higher effective population size in rhesus
    macaque, 2) no mitochondrial gene flow, and 3) unilateral and
    male-mediated nuclear gene flow of approximately 10 migrants per
    generation from rhesus to long-tailed macaque. These patterns of genetic
    structure and gene flow suggest extensive ancient introgression from
    Chinese rhesus macaque into the Indo-Chinese long-tailed macaque
    population.>

    <bib-field|abstract|One of the main transitions in evolution is the shift
    from solitary organisms to societies with reproductive division of
    labour. Understanding social evolution requires us to determine how
    ecological, social and genetic factors jointly influence group stability
    and partitioning of reproduction between group members. Here we test the
    role of the three key factors predicted to influence social evolution by
    experimentally manipulating them in a social allodapine bee. We show that
    increased relatedness between nestmates results in more even reproduction
    among group members and a greater productivity per individual. By
    contrast, the degree of reproductive skew is not influenced by the
    opportunity for solitary breeding or by the potential benefits of
    cooperation. Relatedness also has a positive effect on group stability
    and overall productivity. These findings are in line with predictions of
    the tug-of-war models, in which the degree of reproductive division of
    labour is determined primarily by selfish competition between group
    members. The alternative view, where the degree of reproductive skew is
    the outcome of a social contract between potential breeders, was not
    supported by the data.>

    <bib-field|abstract|We investigate the effect of aligner choice on
    inferences of positive selection using site-specific models of molecular
    evolution. We find that independently of the choice of aligner, the rate
    of false positives is unacceptably high. Our study is a whole-genome
    analysis of all protein-coding genes in 12 Drosophila genomes annotated
    in either all 12 species (\\~{}6690 genes) or in the six melanogaster
    group species. We compare six popular aligners: PRANK, T-Coffee,
    ClustalW, ProbCons, AMAP, and MUSCLE, and find that the aligner choice
    strongly influences the estimates of positive selection. Differences
    persist when we use (1) different stringency cutoffs, (2) different
    selection inference models, (3) alignments with or without gaps, and/or
    additional masking, (4) per-site versus per-gene statistics, (5) closely
    related melanogaster group species versus more distant 12 Drosophila
    genomes. Furthermore, we find that these differences are consequential
    for downstream analyses such as determination of over/under-represented
    GO terms associated with positive selection. Visual analysis indicates
    that most sites inferred as positively selected are, in fact, misaligned
    at the codon level, resulting in false positive rates of 48\\%-82\\%.
    PRANK, which has been reported to outperform other aligners in
    simulations, performed best in our empirical study as well.
    Unfortunately, PRANK still had a high, and unacceptable for most
    applications, false positives rate of 50\\%-55\\%. We identify
    misannotations and indels, many of which appear to be located in
    disordered protein regions, as primary culprits for the high
    misalignment-related error levels and discuss possible workaround
    approaches to this apparently pervasive problem in genome-wide
    evolutionary analyses.>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: The evolutionary history of the Asian
    colobines is less understood. Although monophyly of the odd-nosed monkeys
    was recently confirmed, the relationships among the langur genera
    Presbytis, Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus and their position among
    Asian colobines remained unclear. Moreover, in Trachypithecus various
    species groups are recognized, but their affiliations are still disputed.
    To address these issues, mitochondrial and Y chromosomal sequence data
    were phylogenetically related and combined with presence/absence analyses
    of retroposon integrations. RESULTS: The analysed 5 kb fragment of the
    mitochondrial genome allows no resolution of the phylogenetic
    relationships among langur genera, but five retroposon integrations were
    detected which link Trachypithecus and Semnopithecus. According to Y
    chromosomal data and a 573 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b
    gene, a common origin of the species groups T. [cristatus], T. [obscurus]
    and T. [francoisi] and their reciprocal monophyly is supported, which is
    also underpinned by an orthologous retroposon insertion. T. [vetulus]
    clusters within Semnopithecus, which is confirmed by two retroposon
    integrations. Moreover, this species group is paraphyletic, with T.
    vetulus forming a clade with the Sri Lankan, and T. johnii with the South
    Indian form of S. entellus. Incongruence between gene trees was detected
    for T. [pileatus], in that Y chromosomal data link it with T.
    [cristatus], T. [obscurus] and T. [francoisi], whereas mitochondrial data
    affiliates it with the Semnopithecus clade. CONCLUSION: Neither
    relationships among the three langur genera nor their position within
    Asian colobines can be settled with 5 kb mitochondrial sequence data, but
    retroposon integrations confirm at least a common origin of Semnopithecus
    and Trachypithecus. According to Y chromosomal and 573 bp mitochondrial
    sequence data, T. [cristatus], T. [obscurus] and T. [francoisi] represent
    true members of the genus Trachypithecus, whereas T. [vetulus] clusters
    within Semnopithecus. Due to paraphyly of T. [vetulus] and polyphyly of
    Semnopithecus, a split of the genus into three species groups (S.
    entellus - North India, S. entellus - South India + T. johnii, S.
    entellus - Sri Lanka + T. vetulus) seems to be appropriate. T. [pileatus]
    posses an intermediate position between both genera, indicating that the
    species group might be the result of ancestral hybridization.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Model selection is a topic of special relevance in
    molecular phylogenetics that affects many, if not all, stages of
    phylogenetic inference. Here we discuss some fundamental concepts and
    techniques of model selection in the context of phylogenetics. We start
    by reviewing different aspects of the selection of substitution models in
    phylogenetics from a theoretical, philosophical and practical point of
    view, and summarize this comparison in table format. We argue that the
    most commonly implemented model selection approach, the hierarchical
    likelihood ratio test, is not the optimal strategy for model selection in
    phylogenetics, and that approaches like the Akaike Information Criterion
    (AIC) and Bayesian methods offer important advantages. In particular, the
    latter two methods are able to simultaneously compare multiple nested or
    nonnested models, assess model selection uncertainty, and allow for the
    estimation of phylogenies and model parameters using all available models
    (model-averaged inference or multimodel inference). We also describe how
    the relative importance of the different parameters included in
    substitution models can be depicted. To illustrate some of these points,
    we have applied AIC-based model averaging to 37 mitochondrial DNA
    sequences from the subgenus Ohomopterus(genus Carabus) ground beetles
    described by Sota and Vogler (2001).>

    <bib-field|abstract|Gene expression in normal cells is highly regulated
    by complex gene regulatory networks. Disruption of these networks may
    lead to cancer. Recent studies have revealed the existence of an abundant
    class of small nonprotein-coding regulatory RNAs, known as microRNAs
    (miRNAs). MiRNAs may regulate diverse biological processes including
    development, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, through
    suppressing the expression of their target genes. Posttranscriptional
    silencing of target genes by miRNAs occurs either by cleavage of
    homologous target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), or by inhibition of target
    protein synthesis. Computational predictions indicate that 1 miRNA may
    target on hundreds of genes, and suggest that over 50\\% of human
    protein-coding genes might be regulated by miRNAs. MiRNAs are receiving
    increased attention in cancer genomic research. We are beginning to
    understand that miRNAs may act as oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes
    within the molecular architecture of gene regulatory networks, thereby
    contributing to the development of cancer. MiRNAs may provide useful
    diagnostic and prognostic markers for cancer diagnosis and treatment, as
    well as serving as potential therapeutic targets or tools.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Cytokinesis is incomplete in spermatogenic cells, and
    the descendants of each stem cell form a clonal syncytium. As a result, a
    heterozygous mutation in a gene expressed postmeiotically affects all of
    the haploid spermatids within a syncytium. Previously, we have found that
    disruption of one copy of the gene for either protamine 1 (PRM1) or
    protamine 2 (PRM2) in the mouse results in a reduction in the amount of
    the respective protein, abnormal processing of PRM2, and inability of
    male chimeras to transmit either the mutant or wild-type allele derived
    from the 129-genotype embryonic stem cells to the next generation.
    Although it is believed that protamines are essential for compaction of
    the sperm nucleus and to protect the DNA from damage, this has not been
    proven experimentally. To test the hypothesis that failure of chimeras to
    transmit the 129 genotype to offspring was due to alterations in the
    organization and integrity of sperm DNA, we used the single-cell DNA
    electrophoresis (comet) assay, ultrastructural analysis, and the
    intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedure. Comet assay
    demonstrated a direct correlation between the fraction of sperm with
    haploinsufficiency of PRM2 and the frequency of sperm with damaged DNA.
    Ultrastructural analysis revealed reduced compaction of the chromatin.
    ICSI with PRM2-deficient sperm resulted in activation of most metaphase
    II-arrested mouse eggs, but few were able to develop to the blastocyst
    stage. These findings suggest that development fails because of damage to
    paternal DNA and that PRM2 is crucial for maintaining the integrity of
    sperm chromatin.>

    of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions in mammalian star
    phylogenies (rodentia, artiodactyla, and primates). The average pattern
    of the 49 genes supports the prediction of the nearly neutral theory,
    with some notable exceptions. The nearly neutral theory also predicts
    that the variance of the evolutionary rate is larger than the value
    predicted by the completely neutral theory. This prediction is tested by
    examining the dispersion index (ratio of the variance to the mean), which
    is positively correlated with the average substitution number. After
    weighting by the lineage effects, this correlation almost disappears for
    nonsynonymous substitutions, but not quite so for synonymous
    substitutions. After weighting, the dispersion indices of both synonymous
    and nonsynonymous substitutions still exceed values expected under the
    simple Poisson process. The results indicate that both the systematic
    bias in evolutionary rate among the lineages and the episodic type of
    rate variation are contributing to the large variance. The former is more
    significant to synonymous substitutions than to nonsynonymous
    substitutions. Isochore evolution may be similar to synonymous
    substitutions. The rate and pattern found here are consistent with the
    nearly neutral theory, such that the relative contributions of drift and
    selection differ between the two types of substitutions. The results are
    also consistent with Gillespie's episodic selection theory.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The newly sequenced genome sequences of 11 Drosophila
    species provide the first opportunity to investigate variations in
    evolutionary rates across a clade of closely related species.
    Protein-coding genes were predicted using established Drosophila
    melanogaster genes as templates, with recovery rates ranging from
    81\\%-97\\% depending on species divergence and on genome assembly
    quality. Orthology and paralogy assignments were shown to be
    self-consistent among the different Drosophila species and to be
    consistent with regions of conserved gene order (synteny blocks). Next,
    we investigated the rates of diversification among these species' gene
    repertoires with respect to amino acid substitutions and to gene
    duplications. Constraints on amino acid sequences appear to have been
    most pronounced on D. ananassae and least pronounced on D. simulans and
    D. erecta terminal lineages. Codons predicted to have been subject to
    positive selection were found to be significantly over-represented among
    genes with roles in immune response and RNA metabolism, with the latter
    category including each subunit of the Dicer-2/r2d2 heterodimer. The vast
    majority of gene duplications (96.5\\%) and synteny rearrangements were
    found to occur, as expected, within single M\\"{u}ller elements. We show
    that the rate of ancient gene duplications was relatively uniform.
    However, gene duplications in terminal lineages are strongly skewed
    toward very recent events, consistent with either a rapid-birth and
    rapid-death model or the presence of large proportions of copy number
    variable genes in these Drosophila populations. Duplications were
    significantly more frequent among trypsin-like proteases and DM8 putative
    lipid-binding domain proteins.>

    <bib-field|abstract|For years evolutionary biologists have been
    interested in searching for the genetic bases underlying humanness.
    Recent efforts at a large or a complete genomic scale have been conducted
    to search for positively selected genes in human and in chimp. However,
    recently developed methods allowing for a more sensitive and controlled
    approach in the detection of positive selection can be employed. Here,
    using 13,198 genes, we have deduced the sets of genes involved in rate
    acceleration, positive selection, and relaxation of selective constraints
    in human, in chimp, and in their ancestral lineage since the divergence
    from murids. Significant deviations from the strict molecular clock were
    observed in 469 human and in 651 chimp genes. The more stringent
    branch-site test of positive selection detected 108 human and 577 chimp
    positively selected genes. An important proportion of the positively
    selected genes did not show a significant acceleration in rates, and
    similarly, many of the accelerated genes did not show significant signals
    of positive selection. Functional differentiation of genes under rate
    acceleration, positive selection, and relaxation was not statistically
    significant between human and chimp with the exception of terms related
    to G-protein coupled receptors and sensory perception. Both of these were
    over-represented under relaxation in human in relation to chimp.
    Comparing differences between derived and ancestral lineages, a more
    conspicuous change in trends seems to have favored positive selection in
    the human lineage. Since most of the positively selected genes are
    different under the same functional categories between these species, we
    suggest that the individual roles of the alternative positively selected
    genes may be an important factor underlying biological differences
    between these species.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Sperm competition, the contest among ejaculates from
    rival males to fertilize ova of a female, is a common and powerful
    evolutionary force influencing ejaculate traits. During competitive
    interactions between ejaculates, longer and faster spermatozoa are
    expected to have an edge; however, to date, there has been mixed support
    for this key prediction from sperm competition theory. Here, we use the
    spectacular radiation of cichlid fishes from Lake Tanganyika to examine
    sperm characteristics in 29 closely related species. We provide
    phylogenetically robust evidence that species experiencing greater levels
    of sperm competition have faster-swimming sperm. We also show that sperm
    competition selects for increases in the number, size, and longevity of
    spermatozoa in the ejaculate of a male, and, contrary to expectations
    from theory, we find no evidence of trade-offs among sperm traits in an
    interspecific analysis. Also, sperm swimming speed is positively
    correlated with sperm length among, but not within, species. These
    different responses to sperm competition at intra- and interspecific
    levels provide a simple, powerful explanation for equivocal results from
    previous studies. Using phylogenetic analyses, we also reconstructed the
    probable evolutionary route of trait evolution in this taxon, and show
    that, in response to increases in the magnitude of sperm competition, the
    evolution of sperm traits in this clade began with the evolution of
    faster (thus, more competitive) sperm.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The question is often raised whether it is
    statistically necessary to control for phylogenetic associations in
    comparative studies. To investigate this question, we explore the use of
    a measure of phylogenetic correlation, lambda, introduced by Pagel
    (1999), that normally varies between 0 (phylogenetic independence) and 1
    (species' traits covary in direct proportion to their shared evolutionary
    history). Simulations show lambda to be a statistically powerful index
    for measuring whether data exhibit phylogenetic dependence or not and
    whether it has low rates of Type I error. Moreover, lambda is robust to
    incomplete phylogenetic information, which demonstrates that even partial
    information on phylogeny will improve the accuracy of phylogenetic
    analyses. To assess whether traits generally show phylogenetic
    associations, we present a quantitative review of 26 published
    phylogenetic comparative data sets. The data sets include 103 traits and
    were chosen from the ecological literature in which debate about the need
    for phylogenetic correction has been most acute. Eighty-eight percent of
    data sets contained at least one character that displayed significant
    phylogenetic dependence, and 60\\% of characters overall (pooled across
    studies) showed significant evidence of phylogenetic association. In
    16\\% of tests, phylogenetic correlation could be neither supported nor
    rejected. However, most of these equivocal results were found in small
    phylogenies and probably reflect a lack of power. We suggest that the
    parameter lambda be routinely estimated when analyzing comparative data,
    since it can also be used simultaneously to adjust the phylogenetic
    correction in a manner that is optimal for the data set, and we present
    an example of how this may be done.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Local adaptations within species are often governed
    by several interacting genes scattered throughout the genome.
    Single-locus models of selection cannot explain the maintenance of such
    complex variation because recombination separates co-adapted alleles.
    Here we report a previously unrecognized type of intraspecific
    multi-locus genetic variation that has been maintained over a vast
    period. The galactose (GAL) utilization gene network of Saccharomyces
    kudriavzevii, a relative of brewer's yeast, exists in two distinct
    states: a functional gene network in Portuguese strains and, in Japanese
    strains, a non-functional gene network of allelic pseudogenes. Genome
    sequencing of all available S. kudriavzevii strains revealed that none of
    the functional GAL genes were acquired from other species. Rather, these
    polymorphisms have been maintained for nearly the entire history of the
    species, despite more recent gene flow genome-wide. Experimental evidence
    suggests that inactivation of the GAL3 and GAL80 regulatory genes
    facilitated the origin and long-term maintenance of the two gene network
    states. This striking example of a balanced unlinked gene network
    polymorphism introduces a remarkable type of intraspecific variation that
    may be widespread.>

    <bib-field|abstract|In comparative genomics one analyzes jointly
    evolutionarily related species in order to identify conserved and
    diverged sequences and to infer their function. While such studies
    enabled the detection of conserved sequences in large genomes, the
    evolutionary dynamics of regulatory regions as a whole remain poorly
    understood. Here we present a probabilistic model for the evolution of
    promoter regions in yeast, combining the effects of regulatory
    interactions of many different transcription factors. The model expresses
    explicitly the selection forces acting on transcription factor binding
    sites in the context of a dynamic evolutionary process. We develop
    algorithms to compute likelihood and to learn de novo collections of
    transcription factor binding motifs and their selection parameters from
    alignments. Using the new techniques, we examine the evolutionary
    dynamics in Saccharomyces species promoters. Analyses of an evolutionary
    model constructed using all known transcription factor binding motifs and
    of a model learned from the data automatically reveal relatively weak
    selection on most binding sites. Moreover, according to our estimates,
    strong binding sites are constraining only a fraction of the yeast
    promoter sequence that is under selection. Our study demonstrates how
    complex evolutionary dynamics in noncoding regions emerges from
    formalization of the evolutionary consequences of known regulatory
    mechanisms.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Comparison of whole genomes has revealed large and
    frequent changes in the size of gene families. These changes occur
    because of high rates of both gene gain (via duplication) and loss (via
    deletion or pseudogenization), as well as the evolution of entirely new
    genes. Here we use the genomes of 12 fully sequenced Drosophila species
    to study the gain and loss of genes at unprecedented resolution. We find
    large numbers of both gains and losses, with over 40\\% of all gene
    families differing in size among the Drosophila. Approximately 17 genes
    are estimated to be duplicated and fixed in a genome every million years,
    a rate on par with that previously found in both yeast and mammals. We
    find many instances of extreme expansions or contractions in the size of
    gene families, including the expansion of several sex- and
    spermatogenesis-related families in D. melanogaster that also evolve
    under positive selection at the nucleotide level. Newly evolved gene
    families in our dataset are associated with a class of testes-expressed
    genes known to have evolved de novo in a number of cases. Gene family
    comparisons also allow us to identify a number of annotated D.
    melanogaster genes that are unlikely to encode functional proteins, as
    well as to identify dozens of previously unannotated D. melanogaster
    genes with conserved homologs in the other Drosophila. Taken together,
    our results demonstrate that the apparent stasis in total gene number
    among species has masked rapid turnover in individual gene gain and loss.
    It is likely that this genomic revolving door has played a large role in
    shaping the morphological, physiological, and metabolic differences among
    species.>

    <bib-field|abstract|We have assessed the allometric relationship between
    mass of testes and body mass using data from 133 mammalian species. The
    logarithmically transformed data were fitted by a regression (r2=0.86)
    that is described by the power function: Y=0.035 X0.72, where Y is mass
    of both testes in grams and X is body mass in grams. The slopes and
    intercepts of the allometric relationship for rodents alone (62 species)
    and primates alone (28 species) do not differ significantly from the
    relationship for the 133 species all taken together. Smaller mammals must
    allocate a greater proportion of body mass and of energy expenditure to
    testicular tissue than larger mammals; according to our allometric
    equation the testes of a 10 g mammal should comprise 1.8 percent of body
    mass, whereas testes of a 10,000 kg mammal amount to only 0.04 percent.
    Among the smallest mammals, the range of relative testes size is great;
    the testes of some rodents are as large as 8 percent of body mass,
    whereas others are as small as 0.15 percent. The energy cost for growth,
    maintenance, and production by mammalian testes is proportional to mass
    of testes and is, therefore, in most cases negligible. Among mammals in
    general we found no correlation between size of the testes and their
    location (abdominal or scrotal) in the body, or between size of testes
    and body form and mode of locomotion (terrestrial, aquatic, aerial). A
    functional relationship exists in many mammals between relative size of
    testes and mating system. Testes are relatively small in single-male
    breeding systems (monogamy or cases of extreme polygyny in which a single
    male does all the breeding). Testes are relatively large in multi-male
    breeding systems (promiscuous or polygynous systems where several
    different males mate with each female at the same estrus). In these
    cases, the evolution of large testes can be attributed to high copulatory
    frequency and sperm production and the competition among sperm of
    different males for fertilization of the same female. Size of testes has
    undoubtedly evolved in each species in response to a variety of
    additional factors beyond the first-order influence of body size. Tests
    of further hypotheses (for example, degree of seasonality of mating) that
    may explain the additional variability in size of testes should be
    performed. This should involve multivariate analyses of large data sets
    or simpler analyses that use data sets restricted to animals of similar
    body size, lower-level taxon, mating system, etc.>

    <bib-field|abstract|We consider three approaches for estimating the rates
    of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes at each site in a sequence
    alignment in order to identify sites under positive or negative
    selection: (1) a suite of fast likelihood-based "counting methods" that
    employ either a single most likely ancestral reconstruction, weighting
    across all possible ancestral reconstructions, or sampling from ancestral
    reconstructions; (2) a random effects likelihood (REL) approach, which
    models variation in nonsynonymous and synonymous rates across sites
    according to a predefined distribution, with the selection pressure at an
    individual site inferred using an empirical Bayes approach; and (3) a
    fixed effects likelihood (FEL) method that directly estimates
    nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates at each site. All three
    methods incorporate flexible models of nucleotide substitution bias and
    variation in both nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates across
    sites, facilitating the comparison between the methods. We demonstrate
    that the results obtained using these approaches show broad agreement in
    levels of Type I and Type II error and in estimates of substitution
    rates. Counting methods are well suited for large alignments, for which
    there is high power to detect positive and negative selection, but appear
    to underestimate the substitution rate. A REL approach, which is more
    computationally intensive than counting methods, has higher power than
    counting methods to detect selection in data sets of intermediate size
    but may suffer from higher rates of false positives for small data sets.
    A FEL approach appears to capture the pattern of rate variation better
    than counting methods or random effects models, does not suffer from as
    many false positives as random effects models for data sets comprising
    few sequences, and can be efficiently parallelized. Our results suggest
    that previously reported differences between results obtained by counting
    methods and random effects models arise due to a combination of the
    conservative nature of counting-based methods, the failure of current
    random effects models to allow for variation in synonymous substitution
    rates, and the naive application of random effects models to extremely
    sparse data sets. We demonstrate our methods on sequence data from the
    human immunodeficiency virus type 1 env and pol genes and simulated
    alignments.>

    <bib-field|abstract|One-to-one orthologous genes of relatively closely
    related species are widely assumed to have similar functions and cause
    similar phenotypes when deleted from the genome. Although this assumption
    is the foundation of comparative genomics and the basis for the use of
    model organisms to study human biology and disease, its validity is known
    only from anecdotes rather than from systematic examination. Comparing
    documented phenotypes of null mutations in humans and mice, we find that
    \>20\\% of human essential genes have nonessential mouse orthologs. These
    changes of gene essentiality appear to be associated with adaptive
    evolution at the protein-sequence, but not gene-expression, level.
    Proteins localized to the vacuole, a cellular compartment for waste
    management, are highly enriched among essentiality-changing genes. It is
    probable that the evolution of the prolonged life history in humans
    required enhanced waste management for proper cellular function until the
    time of reproduction, which rendered these vacuole proteins essential and
    generated selective pressures for their improvement. If our gene sample
    represents the entire genome, our results would mean frequent changes of
    phenotypic effects of one-to-one orthologous genes even between
    relatively closely related species, a possibility that should be
    considered in comparative genomic studies and in making cross-species
    inferences of gene function and phenotypic effect.>

    <bib-field|abstract|One of the fundamental questions of ecology is what
    controls biodiversity. Recent theory suggests that biodiversity is
    controlled predominantly by neutral drift of species abundances. This
    theory has generated considerable controversy, because it claims that
    many mechanisms that have long been studied by ecologists (such as
    niches) have little involvement in structuring communities. The theory
    predicts that the species abundance distribution within a community
    should follow a zero-sum multinomial distribution (ZSM), but this has
    not, so far, been rigorously tested. Specifically, it remains to be shown
    that the ZSM fits the data significantly better than reasonable null
    models. Here I test whether the ZSM fits several empirical data sets
    better than the lognormal distribution. It does not. Not only does the
    ZSM fail to fit empirical data better than the lognormal distribution
    95\\% of the time, it also fails to fit empirical data better even a
    majority of the time. This means that there is no evidence that the ZSM
    predicts abundances better than the much more parsimonious null
    hypothesis.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)
    allows for the simultaneous examination of thousands of genomic loci at
    1-2 Mb resolution. Copy number alterations detected by array-based CGH
    can aid in the identification and localization of cancer causing genes.
    Here we report the results of array-based CGH in a set of 125 primary
    colorectal tumors hybridized onto an array consisting of 2463 bacterial
    artificial chromosome clones. On average, 17.3\\% of the entire genome
    was altered in our samples (8.5 +/- 6.7\\% gained and 8.8 +/- 7.3\\%
    lost). Losses involving 8p, 17p, 18p or 18q occurred in 37, 46, 49 and
    60\\% of cases, respectively. Gains involving 8q or 20q were observed 42
    and 65\\% of the time, respectively. A transition from loss to gain
    occurred on chromosome 8 between 41 and 48 Mb, with 25\\% of cases
    demonstrating a gain of 8p11 (45-53 Mb). Chromosome 8 also contained four
    distinct loci demonstrating high-level amplifications, centering at 44.9,
    60, 92.7 and 144.7 Mb. On 20q multiple high-level amplifications were
    observed, centering at 32.3, 37.8, 45.4, 54.7, 59.4 and 65 Mb. Few
    differences in DNA copy number alterations were associated with tumor
    stage, location, age and sex of the patient. Microsatellite stable and
    unstable (MSI-H) tumors differed significantly with respect to the
    frequency of alterations (20 versus 5\\%, respectively, P \< 0.01).
    Interestingly, MSI-H tumors were also observed to have DNA copy number
    alterations, most commonly involving 8q. This high-resolution analysis of
    DNA copy number alterations in colorectal cancer by array-based CGH
    allowed for the identification of many small, previously uncharacterized,
    genomic regions, such as on chromosomes 8 and 20. Array-based CGH was
    also able to identify DNA copy number changes in MSI-H tumors.

    <bib-field|abstract|Ecologists would like to explain general patterns
    observed across multi-species communities, such as species-area and
    abundance-frequency relationships, in terms of the fundamental processes
    of birth, death and migration underlying the dynamics of all constituent
    species. The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and related theories
    based on these fundamental population processes have successfully
    recreated general species-abundance patterns without accounting for
    either the variation among species and individuals or resource-releasing
    processes such as predation and disturbance, long emphasized in
    ecological theory. If ecological communities can be described adequately
    without estimating variation in species and their interactions, our
    understanding of ecological community organization and the predicted
    consequences of reduced biodiversity and environmental change would shift
    markedly. Here, I introduce a strong method to test the neutral theory
    that combines field parameterization of the underlying population
    dynamics with a field experiment, and apply it to a rocky intertidal
    community. Although the observed abundance-frequency distribution of the
    system follows that predicted by the neutral theory, the neutral theory
    predicts poorly the field experimental results, indicating an essential

    <bib-field|abstract|Interacting or functionally related protein families
    tend to have similar phylogenetic trees. Based on this observation,
    techniques have been developed to predict interaction partners. The
    observed degree of similarity between the phylogenetic trees of two
    proteins is the result of many different factors besides the actual
    interaction or functional relationship between them. Such factors
    influence the performance of interaction predictions. One aspect that can
    influence this similarity is related to the fact that a given protein
    interacts with many others, and hence it must adapt to all of them.
    Accordingly, the interaction or coadaptation signal within its tree is a
    composite of the influence of all of the interactors. Here, we introduce
    a new estimator of coevolution to overcome this and other problems.
    Instead of relying on the individual value of tree similarity between two
    proteins, we use the whole network of similarities between all of the
    pairs of proteins within a genome to reassess the similarity of that
    pair, thereby taking into account its coevolutionary context. We show
    that this approach offers a substantial improvement in interaction
    prediction performance, providing a degree of accuracy/coverage
    comparable with, or in some cases better than, that of experimental
    techniques. Moreover, important information on the structure, function,
    and evolution of macromolecular complexes can be inferred with this
    methodology.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The orientation of closely linked genes in mammalian
    genomes is not random: there are more head-to-head (h2h) gene pairs than
    expected. To understand the origin of this enrichment in h2h gene pairs,
    we have analyzed the phylogenetic distribution of gene pairs separated by
    less than 600 bp of intergenic DNA (gene duos). We show here that a lack
    of head-to-tail (h2t) gene duos is an even more distinctive
    characteristic of mammalian genomes, with the platypus genome as the only
    exception. In nonmammalian vertebrate and in nonvertebrate genomes, the
    frequency of h2h, h2t, and tail-to-tail (t2t) gene duos is close to
    random. In tetrapod genomes, the h2t and t2t gene duos are more likely to
    be part of a larger gene cluster of closely spaced genes than h2h gene
    duos; in fish and urochordate genomes, the reverse is seen. In human and
    mouse tissues, the expression profiles of gene duos were skewed toward
    positive coexpression, irrespective of orientation. The organization of
    orthologs of both members of about 40\\% of the human gene duos could be
    traced in other species, enabling a prediction of the organization at the
    branch points of gnathostomes, tetrapods, amniotes, and euarchontoglires.
    The accumulation of h2h gene duos started in tetrapods, whereas that of
    h2t and t2t gene duos only started in amniotes. The apparent lack of
    evolutionary conservation of h2t and t2t gene duos relative to that of
    h2h gene duos is thus a result of their relatively late origin in the
    lineage leading to mammals; we show that once they are formed h2t and t2t
    gene duos are as stable as h2h gene duos.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Butterfly long-wavelength (L) photopigments are
    interesting for comparative studies of adaptive evolution because of the
    tremendous phenotypic variation that exists in their wavelength of peak
    absorbance (lambda(max) value). Here we present a comprehensive survey of
    L photopigment variation by measuring lambda(max) in 12 nymphalid and 1
    riodinid species using epi-microspectrophotometry. Together with previous
    data, we find that L photopigment lambda(max) varies from 510-565 nm in
    22 nymphalids, with an even broader 505- to 600-nm range in riodinids. We
    then surveyed the L opsin genes for which lambda(max) values are
    available as well as from related taxa and found 2 instances of L opsin
    gene duplication within nymphalids, in Hermeuptychia hermes and Amathusia
    phidippus, and 1 instance within riodinids, in the metalmark butterfly
    Apodemia mormo. Using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood ancestral
    state reconstructions to map the evolution of spectral shifts within the
    L photopigments of nymphalids, we estimate the ancestral pigment had a
    lambda(max) = 540 nm +/- 10 nm standard error and that blueshifts in
    wavelength have occurred at least 4 times within the family. We used
    ancestral state reconstructions to investigate the importance of several
    amino acid substitutions (Ile17Met, Ala64Ser, Asn70Ser, and Ser137Ala)
    previously shown to have evolved under positive selection that are
    correlated with blue spectral shifts. These reconstructions suggest that
    the Ala64Ser substitution has indeed occurred along the newly identified
    blueshifted L photopigment lineages. Substitutions at the other 3 sites
    may also be involved in the functional diversification of L
    photopigments. Our data strongly suggest that there are limits to the
    evolution of L photopigment spectral shifts among species with only one L
    opsin gene and that opsin gene duplication broadens the potential range
    of lambda(max) values.>

    <bib-field|abstract|microRNAs are small noncoding genes that regulate the
    protein production of genes by binding to partially complementary sites
    in the mRNAs of targeted genes. Here, using our algorithm PicTar, we
    exploit cross-species comparisons to predict, on average, 54 targeted
    genes per microRNA above noise in Drosophila melanogaster. Analysis of
    the functional annotation of target genes furthermore suggests specific
    biological functions for many microRNAs. We also predict combinatorial
    targets for clustered microRNAs and find that some clustered microRNAs
    are likely to coordinately regulate target genes. Furthermore, we compare
    microRNA regulation between insects and vertebrates. We find that the
    widespread extent of gene regulation by microRNAs is comparable between
    flies and mammals but that certain microRNAs may function in
    clade-specific modes of gene regulation. One of these microRNAs (miR-210)
    is predicted to contribute to the regulation of fly oogenesis. We also
    list specific regulatory relationships that appear to be conserved
    between flies and mammals. Our findings provide the most extensive
    microRNA target predictions in Drosophila to date, suggest specific
    functional roles for most microRNAs, indicate the existence of coordinate
    gene regulation executed by clustered microRNAs, and shed light on the
    evolution of microRNA function across large evolutionary distances. All
    predictions are freely accessible at our searchable Web site

    <bib-field|abstract|Understanding the genetic architecture of a
    phenotypic character implies knowing the character variational
    properties. In this sense, the study of olfactory behavior in Drosophila
    species at the molecular variational level has always been done in terms
    of molecular evolution of particular gene families, such as odorant
    receptor (or) or odorant binding proteins (Obp). The aim of our work is
    to understand the molecular evolution of olfactory behavior in
    Drosophila, taking into account all known genes involved in the genetic
    architecture of the character. Bioinformatics tools were used to perform
    a comparative analysis of olfactory genes using the available complete
    genome sequence of the 6 species in the melanogaster species group of the
    Drosophila genus. We analyzed 105 olfactory genes in total. Our results
    revealed that: i) there is widespread purifying selection in olfactory
    genes ii) genes that are expressed only in larval or adult olfactory
    behavior show no differences in their evolutionary rate with respect to
    genes expressed in both life stages iii) genes expressed in a
    “primary” level of the olfactory stimuli transmission (Obp and or
    genes) show a faster evolutionary rate than genes expressed in a
    “secondary” level; presumably because “secondary” level genes
    present greater pleitropy, which leads to greater functional
    constraints.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Genetic sequence alignment is the basis of many

    Traditional multiple sequence alignment methods disregard the
    phylogenetic implications of gap patterns that they create and infer
    systematically biased alignments with excess deletions and substitutions,
    too few insertions, and implausible insertion-deletion-event histories.
    We present a method that prevents these systematic errors by recognizing
    insertions and deletions as distinct evolutionary events. We show
    theoretically and practically that this improves the quality of sequence
    alignments and downstream analyses over a wide range of realistic
    alignment problems. These results suggest that insertions and sequence
    turnover are more common than is currently thought and challenge the

    The network contains nearly 3000 metabolic reactions, which were

    <bib-field|abstract|Distance-based methods for phylogeny reconstruction
    are the fastest and easiest to use, and their popularity is accordingly
    high. They are also the only known methods that can cope with huge
    datasets of thousands of sequences. These methods rely on evolutionary
    distance estimation and are sensitive to errors in such estimations. In
    this study, a novel Bayesian method for estimation of evolutionary
    distances is developed. The proposed method enables the use of a
    sophisticated evolutionary model that better accounts for among-site rate
    variation (ASRV), thereby improving the accuracy of distance estimation.
    Rate variations are estimated within a Bayesian framework by extracting
    information from the entire dataset of sequences, unlike standard methods
    that can only use one pair of sequences at a time. We compare the
    accuracy of a cascade of distance estimation methods, starting from
    commonly used methods and moving towards the more sophisticated novel
    method. Simulation studies show significant improvements in the accuracy
    of distance estimation by the novel method over the commonly used ones.
    We demonstrate the effect of the improved accuracy on tree reconstruction
    using both real and simulated protein sequence alignments. An
    implementation of this method is available as part of the SEMPHY

    <bib-field|abstract|Abstract\\&nbsp;\\&nbsp;The evolution of genome size
    as well as structure and organization of genomes belongs among the key
    questions of genome biology. Here we show, based on a comparative
    analysis of 30 genomes, that there is generally a tight correlation
    between the number of genes per chromosome and the length of the
    respective chromosome in eukaryotic genomes. The surprising exceptions to
    this pattern are placental mammalian genomes. We identify the number and,
    more importantly, the uneven distribution of gene deserts among
    chromosomes, i.e., long (\\&gt;500\\&nbsp;kb) stretches of DNA that do
    not encode for genes, as the main contributing factor for the observed
    anomaly of eutherian genomes. Gene-rich placental mammalian chromosomes
    have smaller proportions of gene deserts and vice versa. We show that the
    uneven distribution of gene deserts is a derived character state of
    eutherians. The functional and evolutionary significance of this
    particular feature of eutherian genomes remains to be explained.>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: Testes size is used as a proxy of male
    intrasexual competition, with larger testes indicative of greater
    competition. It has been shown that in some taxa, social mating systems
    reflect variance in testes size, but results are not consistent, and
    instead it has been suggested that genetic patterns of mating may reflect
    testes size. However, there are different measures of genetic patterns of
    mating. Multiple paternity rates are the most widely used measure but are
    limited to species that produce multi-offspring litters, so, at least for
    group living species, other measures such as loss of paternity to males
    outside the social group (extra group paternity) or the proportion of
    offspring sired by the dominant male (alpha paternity) might be
    appropriate. This study examines the relationship between testes size and
    three genetic patterns of mating: multiple paternity, extragroup
    paternity and alpha paternity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using data
    from mammals, phylogenetically corrected general linear models
    demonstrate that both multiple paternity and alpha paternity, but not
    extra group paternity, relate to testes size. Testes size is greater in
    species with high multiple paternity rates, whereas the converse is found
    for alpha paternity. Additionally, length of mating season, ovulation
    mode and litter size significantly influenced testes size in one model.
    CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results demonstrate that patterns of
    mating (multiple paternity and alpha paternity rates) determined by
    genetic analysis can provide reliable indicators of male postcopulatory
    intrasexual competition (testes size), and that other variables (length
    of mating season, ovulation mode, litter size) may also be important.>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: Alternative splicing expands
    transcriptome diversity and plays an important role in regulation of gene
    expression. Previous studies focus on the regulation of a single cassette
    exon, but recent experiments indicate that multiple cassette exons within
    a gene may interact with each other. This interaction can increase the
    potential to generate various transcripts and adds an extra layer of
    complexity to gene regulation. Several cases of exon interaction have
    been discovered. However, the extent to which the cassette exons
    coordinate with each other remains unknown. RESULTS: Based on EST data,
    we employed a metric of correlation coefficients to describe the
    interaction between two adjacent cassette exons and then categorized
    these exon pairs into three different groups by their interaction
    (correlation) patterns. Sequence analysis demonstrates that
    strongly-correlated groups are more conserved and contain a higher
    proportion of pairs with reading frame preservation in a combinatorial
    manner. Multiple genome comparison further indicates that different
    groups of correlated pairs have different evolutionary courses: (1) The
    vast majority of positively-correlated pairs are old, (2) most of the
    weakly-correlated pairs are relatively young, and (3)
    negatively-correlated pairs are a mixture of old and young events.
    CONCLUSION: We performed a large-scale analysis of interactions between
    adjacent cassette exons. Compared with weakly-correlated pairs, the
    strongly-correlated pairs, including both the positively and negatively
    correlated ones, show more evidence that they are under delicate splicing
    control and tend to be functionally important. Additionally, the
    positively-correlated pairs bear strong resemblance to constitutive
    exons, which suggests that they may evolve from ancient constitutive
    exons, while negatively and weakly correlated pairs are more likely to
    contain newly emerging exons.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Recombination contributes to the generation of
    genetic diversity in human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) but can only
    occur between viruses replicating within the same cell. Since individuals
    have not been found to be simultaneously coinfected with multiple
    divergent strains of HIV-1 or HIV-2, recombination events have been
    thought to be restricted to the rather closely related members of the
    quasispecies that evolves during the course of HIV infection. Here we
    describe examples of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 genomes that appear to be
    hybrids of genetically quite divergent viruses. Phylogenetic analyses
    were used to examine the evolutionary relationships among multiple HIV
    strains. Evolutionary trees derived from different genomic regions were
    consistent with respect to most of the viruses investigated. However,
    some strains of HIV-1 and HIV-2 exhibited significantly discordant
    branching orders indicative of genetic exchanges during their
    evolutionary histories. The crossover points of these putative
    recombination events were mapped by examining the distribution of
    phylogenetically informative sites supporting alternative tree
    topologies. A similar example of a recombinant simian immunodeficiency
    virus identified in West African green monkeys has also been described
    recently. These results indicate that coinfection with highly divergent
    viral strains can occur in HIV-infected humans and SIV-infected primates
    and could lead to the generation of hybrid genomes with significantly
    altered biological properties. Thus, future characterization of primate
    lentiviruses should include careful phylogenetic investigation of
    possible genomic mosaicism.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Copy number variation (CNV) in terms of aneuploidies
    of both entire chromosomes and chromosomal segments is an important
    evolutionary driving force, but it is inevitably accompanied by
    potentially problematic variations in gene doses and genomic instability.
    Thus, a delicate balance must be maintained between mechanisms that
    compensate for variations in gene doses (and thus allow such genomic
    variability) and selection against destabilizing CNVs. In Drosophila,
    three known compensatory mechanisms have evolved: a general segmental
    aneuploidy-buffering system and two chromosome-specific systems. The two
    chromosome-specific systems are the male-specific lethal complex, which
    is important for dosage compensation of the male X chromosome, and
    Painting of fourth, which stimulates expression of the fourth chromosome.
    In this review, we discuss the origin and function of buffering and
    compensation using Drosophila as a model.>

    <bib-field|abstract|We present a maximum-likelihood method for examining

    Using a combined model for the evolution of noncoding and coding regions,
    we develop two likelihood-ratio tests for the detection of selection in
    noncoding regions. Data analysis of both simulated and real viral data is
    presented. Using the new method we show that positive selection in

    <bib-field|abstract|A diverse body of morphological and genetic evidence
    has suggested that traits pertaining to male reproduction may have
    evolved much more rapidly than other types of character. Recently, DNA
    sequence comparisons have also shown a very high level of divergence in
    male reproductive proteins between closely related Drosophila species,
    among marine invertebrates and between mouse and rat. Here we show that
    rapid evolution of male reproductive genes is observable in primates and
    is quite notable in the lineages to human and chimpanzee. Nevertheless,
    rapid evolution by itself is not necessarily an indication of positive
    darwinian selection; relaxation of negative selection is often equally
    compatible with the DNA sequence data. By taking three statistical
    approaches, we show that positive darwinian selection is often the
    driving force behind this rapid evolution. These results open up
    opportunities to test the hypothesis that sexual selection plays some
    role in the molecular evolution of higher primates.>

    <bib-field|abstract|A common pattern observed in molecular evolution is
    that reproductive genes tend to evolve rapidly. However, most previous
    studies documenting this rapid evolution are based on genes expressed in
    just a few male reproductive organs. In mammals, sperm become motile and
    capable of fertilization only after leaving the testis, during their
    transit through the epididymis. Thus, genes expressed in the epididymis
    are expected to play important roles in male fertility. Here, we
    performed evolutionary genetic analyses on the epididymal transcriptome
    of mice. Overall, epididymis-expressed genes showed evidence of strong
    evolutionary constraint, a finding that contrasts with most previous
    analyses of genes expressed in other male reproductive organs. However, a
    subset of epididymis-specialized, secreted genes showed several
    signatures of adaptive evolution, including an increased rate of
    nonsynonymous evolution. Furthermore, this subset of genes was
    overrepresented on the X chromosome. Immunity and protein modification
    functions were significantly overrepresented among
    epididymis-specialized, secreted genes. These analyses identified a group
    of genes likely to be important in male reproductive success.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Recent advances in the large-scale sequencing of
    mammalian genomes have provided a means to study divergence in not only
    genic sequences but also in the non-coding bulk of DNA. There is evidence
    of significant variation in the levels of divergence between presumably
    neutral regions, pointing at an underlying variation in the rate of
    mutation across the genome. Apparently, such variation occurs on
    different scales, including sequence context effects (the influence of
    neighboring nucleotides on the rate of mutation at individual sites),
    variation within chromosomes (on the scales of kilobases as well as
    megabases), and between chromosomes (among autosomes as well as between
    autosomes and sex chromosomes). An important aspect for further research
    in this area is to study whether there is an ultimate evolutionary
    explanation for mutation rate variation within mammalian genomes.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is a prominent
    mechanism to generate protein diversity, yet its regulation is poorly

    alternative splicing. We found distinctive histone modification
    signatures that correlate with the splicing outcome in a set of human
    genes, and modulation of histone modifications causes splice site
    switching. Histone marks affect splicing outcome by influencing the
    recruitment of splicing regulators via a chromatin-binding protein. These

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND:MicroRNAs are an important class of
    regulatory RNAs which repress animal genes by preferentially interacting
    with complementary sequence motifs in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of
    target mRNAs. Computational methods have been developed which can
    successfully predict which microRNA may target which mRNA on a
    genome-wide scale.RESULTS:We address how predicted target sites may be
    affected by alternative polyadenylation events changing the 3'UTR
    sequence. We find that two thirds of targeted genes have alternative
    3'UTRs, with 40 of predicted target sites located in alternative UTR
    segments. We propose three classes based on whether the target sites fall
    within constitutive and/or alternative UTR segments, and examine the
    spatial distribution of predicted targets in alternative UTRs. In
    particular, there is a strong preference for targets to be located in
    close vicinity of the stop codon and the polyadenylation
    sites.CONCLUSION:The transcript diversity seen in non-coding regions, as
    well as the relative location of miRNA target sites defined by it, has a
    potentially large impact on gene regulation by miRNAs and should be taken
    into account when defining, predicting or validating miRNA targets.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The theory of island biogeography asserts that an
    island or a local community approaches an equilibrium species richness as
    a result of the interplay between the immigration of species from the
    much larger metacommunity source area and local extinction of species on
    the island (local community). Hubbell generalized this neutral theory to
    explore the expected steady-state distribution of relative species
    abundance (RSA) in the local community under restricted immigration. Here
    we present a theoretical framework for the unified neutral theory of
    biodiversity and an analytical solution for the distribution of the RSA
    both in the metacommunity (Fisher's log series) and in the local
    community, where there are fewer rare species. Rare species are more
    extinction-prone, and once they go locally extinct, they take longer to
    re-immigrate than do common species. Contrary to recent assertions, we
    show that the analytical solution provides a better fit, with fewer free
    parameters, to the RSA distribution of tree species on Barro Colorado
    Island, Panama, than the lognormal distribution.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Positive Darwinian selection promotes fixations of
    advantageous mutations during gene evolution and is probably responsible
    for most adaptations. Detecting positive selection at the DNA sequence
    level is of substantial interest because such information provides
    significant insights into possible functional alterations during gene
    evolution as well as important nucleotide substitutions involved in
    adaptation. Efficient detection of positive selection, however, has been
    difficult because selection often operates on only a few sites in a short
    period of evolutionary time. A likelihood-based method with branch-site
    models was recently introduced to overcome such difficulties. Here I
    examine the accuracy of the method using computer simulation. I find that
    the method detects positive selection in 20\\%-70\\% of cases when the
    DNA sequences are generated by computer simulation under no positive
    selection. Although the frequency of such false detection varies
    depending on, among other things, the tree topology, branch length, and
    selection scheme, the branch-site likelihood method generally gives
    misleading results. Thus, detection of positive selection by this method
    alone is unreliable. This unreliability may have resulted from its
    over-sensitivity to violations of assumptions made in the method, such as
    certain distributions of selective strength among sites and equal
    transition/transversion ratios for synonymous and nonsynonymous
    substitutions.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Population genetic theory suggests that natural
    selection should be less effective in regions of low recombination,
    potentially leading to differences in rates of adaptation among
    recombination environments. To date, this prediction has mainly been
    tested in Drosophila, with somewhat conflicting results. We investigated
    the association between human recombination rates and adaptation in
    primates, by considering rates of protein evolution (measured by
    d(N)/d(S)) between human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque. We found no
    correlation between either broad- or fine-scale rates of recombination
    and rates of protein evolution, once GC content is taken into account.
    Moreover, genes in regions of very low recombination, which are expected
    to show the most pronounced reduction in the efficacy of selection, do
    not evolve at a different rate than other genes. Thus, there is no
    evidence for differences in the efficacy of selection across
    recombinational environments. An interesting implication is that indirect
    selection for recombination modifiers has probably been a weak force in
    primate evolution.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Codon usage bias, the preferential use of particular
    codons within each codon family, is characteristic of synonymous base
    composition in many species, including Drosophila, yeast, and many
    bacteria. Preferential usage of particular codons in these species is
    maintained by natural selection acting largely at the level of
    translation. In Drosophila, as in bacteria, the rate of synonymous
    substitution per site is negatively correlated with the degree of codon
    usage bias, indicating stronger selection on codon usage in genes with
    high codon bias than in genes with low codon bias. Surprisingly, in these
    organisms, as well as in mammals, the rate of synonymous substitution is
    also positively correlated with the rate of nonsynonymous substitution.
    To investigate this correlation, we carried out a phylogenetic analysis
    of substitutions in 22 genes between two species of Drosophila,
    Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. subobscura, in codons that differ by one
    replacement and one synonymous change. We provide evidence for a relative
    excess of double substitutions in the same species lineage that cannot be
    explained by the simultaneous mutation of two adjacent bases. The
    synonymous changes in these codons also cannot be explained by a shift to
    a more preferred codon following a replacement substitution. We,
    therefore, interpret the excess of double codon substitutions within a
    lineage as being the result of relaxed constraints on both kinds of
    substitutions in particular codons.>

    <bib-field|abstract|While sequencing of the human genome surprised us
    with how many protein-coding genes there are, it did not fundamentally
    change our perspective on what a gene is. In contrast, the complex
    patterns of dispersed regulation and pervasive transcription uncovered by
    the ENCODE project, together with non-genic conservation and the
    abundance of noncoding RNA genes, have challenged the notion of the gene.
    To illustrate this, we review the evolution of operational definitions of
    a gene over the past century--from the abstract elements of heredity of
    Mendel and Morgan to the present-day ORFs enumerated in the sequence
    databanks. We then summarize the current ENCODE findings and provide a
    computational metaphor for the complexity. Finally, we propose a
    tentative update to the definition of a gene: A gene is a union of
    genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping
    functional products. Our definition side-steps the complexities of
    regulation and transcription by removing the former altogether from the
    definition and arguing that final, functional gene products (rather than
    intermediate transcripts) should be used to group together entities
    associated with a single gene. It also manifests how integral the concept
    of biological function is in defining genes.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Independent of the platform and the analysis methods
    used, the result of a microarray experiment is, in most cases, a list of
    differentially expressed genes. An automatic ontological analysis
    approach has been recently proposed to help with the biological
    interpretation of such results. Currently, this approach is the de facto
    standard for the secondary analysis of high throughput experiments and a
    large number of tools have been developed for this purpose. We present a
    detailed comparison of 14 such tools using the following criteria: scope
    of the analysis, visualization capabilities, statistical model(s) used,
    correction for multiple comparisons, reference microarrays available,
    installation issues and sources of annotation data. This detailed
    analysis of the capabilities of these tools will help researchers choose
    the most appropriate tool for a given type of analysis. More importantly,
    in spite of the fact that this type of analysis has been generally
    adopted, this approach has several important intrinsic drawbacks. These
    drawbacks are associated with all tools discussed and represent
    conceptual limitations of the current state-of-the-art in ontological
    analysis. We propose these as challenges for the next generation of
    secondary data analysis tools.>

    purified protamine HP3. The specificity of antibodies was assessed by
    enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot. They
    recognized three distinct epitopes: One was specific for the protamine P1
    family, another was specific for the protamine P2 family and the third
    was common to both families. All were specific for the human species.
    Antibodies were used to detect protamines in germ cells by indirect
    immunofluorescence and by immunoelectron microscopy. Protamines appeared
    in spermtid nuclei at steps 4-5 of spermiogenesis, i.e., during the
    chromatin condensation process, and were not accumulated in the cytoplasm
    before entering the nucleus.>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: Reproductive proteins are central to the
    continuation of all mammalian species. The evolution of these proteins
    has been greatly influenced by environmental pressures induced by
    pathogens, rival sperm, sexual selection and sexual conflict. Positive
    selection has been demonstrated in many of these proteins with particular
    focus on primate lineages. However, the mammalia are a diverse group in
    terms of mating habits, population sizes and germ line generation times.
    We have examined the selective pressures at work on a number of novel
    reproductive proteins across a wide variety of mammalia. RESULTS: We show
    that selective pressures on reproductive proteins are highly varied. Of
    the 10 genes analyzed in detail, all contain signatures of positive
    selection either across specific sites or in specific lineages or a
    combination of both. Our analysis of SP56 and Col1a1 are entirely novel
    and the results show positively selected sites present in each gene. Our
    findings for the Col1a1 gene are suggestive of a link between positive
    selection and severe disease type. We find evidence in our dataset to
    suggest that interacting proteins are evolving in symphony: most likely
    to maintain interacting functionality. CONCLUSION: Our in silico analyses
    show positively selected sites are occurring near catalytically important
    regions suggesting selective pressure to maximize efficient
    fertilization. In those cases where a mechanism of protein function is
    not fully understood, the sites presented here represent ideal candidates
    for mutational study. This work has highlighted the widespread rate
    heterogeneity in mutational rates across the mammalia and specifically
    has shown that the evolution of reproductive proteins is highly varied
    depending on the species and interacting partners. We have shown that
    positive selection and disease are closely linked in the Col1a1 gene.>

    <bib-field|abstract|A database of coexpressed gene sets can provide
    valuable information for a wide variety of experimental designs, such as
    targeting of genes for functional identification, gene regulation and/or
    protein-protein interactions. Coexpressed gene databases derived from
    publicly available GeneChip data are widely used in Arabidopsis research,
    but platforms that examine coexpression for higher mammals are rather
    limited. Therefore, we have constructed a new database, COXPRESdb
    (coexpressed gene database) (http://coxpresdb.hgc.jp), for coexpressed
    gene lists and networks in human and mouse. Coexpression data could be
    calculated for 19 777 and 21 036 genes in human and mouse, respectively,
    by using the GeneChip data in NCBI GEO. COXPRESdb enables analysis of the
    four types of coexpression networks: (i) highly coexpressed genes for
    every gene, (ii) genes with the same GO annotation, (iii) genes expressed
    in the same tissue and (iv) user-defined gene sets. When the networks
    became too big for the static picture on the web in GO networks or in
    tissue networks, we used Google Maps API to visualize them interactively.
    COXPRESdb also provides a view to compare the human and mouse
    coexpression patterns to estimate the conservation between the two
    species. 10.1093/nar/gkm840>

    <bib-field|abstract|Comparison of relative fixation rates of synonymous
    (silent) and nonsynonymous (amino acid-altering) mutations provides a
    means for understanding the mechanisms of molecular sequence evolution.
    The nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (omega = d(N)d(S)) is an
    important indicator of selective pressure at the protein level, with
    omega = 1 meaning neutral mutations, omega \< 1 purifying selection, and
    omega \> 1 diversifying positive selection. Amino acid sites in a protein
    are expected to be under different selective pressures and have different
    underlying omega ratios. We develop models that account for heterogeneous
    omega ratios among amino acid sites and apply them to phylogenetic
    analyses of protein-coding DNA sequences. These models are useful for
    testing for adaptive molecular evolution and identifying amino acid sites
    under diversifying selection. Ten data sets of genes from nuclear,
    mitochondrial, and viral genomes are analyzed to estimate the
    distributions of omega among sites. In all data sets analyzed, the
    selective pressure indicated by the omega ratio is found to be highly
    heterogeneous among sites. Previously unsuspected Darwinian selection is
    detected in several genes in which the average omega ratio across sites
    is \<1, but in which some sites are clearly under diversifying selection
    with omega \> 1. Genes undergoing positive selection include the
    beta-globin gene from vertebrates, mitochondrial protein-coding genes
    from hominoids, the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from human influenza virus A,
    and HIV-1 env, vif, and pol genes. Tests for the presence of positively
    selected sites and their subsequent identification appear quite robust to
    the specific distributional form assumed for omega and can be achieved
    using any of several models we implement. However, we encountered
    difficulties in estimating the precise distribution of omega among sites
    from real data sets.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Comparative sequence analyses on a collection of
    carefully chosen mammalian genomes could facilitate identification of
    functional elements within the human genome and allow quantification of
    evolutionary constraint at the single nucleotide level. High-resolution
    quantification would be informative for determining the distribution of
    important positions within functional elements and for evaluating the
    relative importance of nucleotide sites that carry single nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs). Because the level of resolution in comparative
    sequence analyses is a direct function of sequence diversity, we propose
    that the information content of a candidate mammalian genome be defined
    as the sequence divergence it would add relative to already-sequenced
    genomes. We show that reliable estimates of genomic sequence divergence
    can be obtained from small genomic regions. On the basis of a multiple
    sequence alignment of approximately 1.4 megabases each from eight
    mammals, we generate such estimates for five unsequenced mammals.
    Estimates of the neutral divergence in these data suggest that a small
    number of diverse mammalian genomes in addition to human, mouse, and rat
    would allow single nucleotide resolution in comparative sequence
    analyses.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Although protein sequences are known to evolve at
    vastly different rates, little is known about what determines their rate
    of evolution. However, a recent study using principal component
    regression (PCR) has concluded that evolutionary rates in yeast are
    primarily governed by a single determinant related to translation
    frequency. Here, we demonstrate that noise in biological data can
    confound PCRs, leading to spurious conclusions. When equalizing noise
    levels across 7 predictor variables used in previous studies, we find no
    evidence that protein evolution is dominated by a single determinant. Our
    results indicate that a variety of factors–including expression level,
    gene dispensability, and protein-protein interactions–may independently
    affect evolutionary rates in yeast. More accurate measurements or more
    sophisticated statistical techniques will be required to determine which
    one, if any, of these factors dominates protein evolution.

    <bib-field|abstract|MicroRNAs are key regulators of gene expression, but
    the precise mechanisms underlying their interaction with their mRNA
    targets are still poorly understood. Here, we systematically investigate
    the role of target-site accessibility, as determined by base-pairing
    interactions within the mRNA, in microRNA target recognition. We
    experimentally show that mutations diminishing target accessibility
    substantially reduce microRNA-mediated translational repression, with
    effects comparable to those of mutations that disrupt sequence
    complementarity. We devise a parameter-free model for microRNA-target
    interaction that computes the difference between the free energy gained
    from the formation of the microRNA-target duplex and the energetic cost
    of unpairing the target to make it accessible to the microRNA. This model
    explains the variability in our experiments, predicts validated targets
    more accurately than existing algorithms, and shows that genomes
    accommodate site accessibility by preferentially positioning targets in
    highly accessible regions. Our study thus demonstrates that target
    accessibility is a critical factor in microRNA function.>

    <bib-field|abstract|This article considers the statistical issues
    relevant to the comparative method in evolutionary biology. A generalized
    linear model (GLM) is presented for the analysis of compar- ative data,
    which can be used to address questions regarding the relationship between
    traits or between traits and environments, the rate of phenotypic
    evolution, the degree of phylogenetic effect, and the ancestral state of
    a character. Our approach thus emphasizes the similanty among
    evolutionary questions asked in comparative studies. We then discuss ways
    of specifying the sources of error involved in a comparative study (e.g.,
    measurement error, error due to evolution along a phylogeny, error due to
    misspecification of a phylogeny) and show how the impact of these sources
    of error can be taken into account in a comparative analysis. In contrast
    to most existing phylogenetic comparative methods, our procedure offers
    substantial flexibility in the choice of microevolutionary assumptions
    underlying the statistical analysis, allowing researchers to choose
    assumptions that are most appropriate for their particular set of data
    and evolutionary question. In developing the approach, we also propose
    novel ways of incorporating within- species variation andlor measurement
    error into phylogenetic analyses, of estimating ancestral states, and of
    considering both continuous (quantitative) and categoncal (qualitative or
    "state") characters in the same analysis.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Ants provide remarkable examples of equivalent
    genotypes developing into divergent and discrete phenotypes. Diploid eggs
    can develop either into queens, which specialize in reproduction, or
    workers, which participate in cooperative tasks such as building the
    nest, collecting food, and rearing the young. In contrast, the
    differentiation between males and females generally depends upon whether
    eggs are fertilized, with fertilized (diploid) eggs giving rise to
    females and unfertilized (haploid) eggs giving rise to males. To obtain a
    comprehensive picture of the relative contributions of gender (sex),
    caste, developmental stage, and species divergence to gene expression
    evolution, we investigated gene expression patterns in pupal and adult
    queens, workers, and males of two species of fire ants, Solenopsis
    invicta and S. richteri. Microarray hybridizations revealed that
    variation in gene expression profiles is influenced more by developmental
    stage than by caste membership, sex, or species identity. The second
    major contributor to variation in gene expression was the combination of
    sex and caste. Although workers and queens share equivalent diploid
    nuclear genomes, they have highly distinctive patterns of gene expression
    in both the pupal and adult stages, as might be expected given their
    extraordinary level of phenotypic differentiation. Overall, the
    difference in the proportion of differentially-expressed genes was
    greater between workers and males than between workers and queens or
    queens and males, consistent with the fact that workers and males share
    neither gender nor reproductive capability. Moreover, between-species
    comparisons revealed that the greatest difference in gene expression
    patterns occurred in adult workers, a finding consistent with the fact
    that adult workers most directly experience the distinct external
    environments characterizing the different habitats occupied by the two
    species. Thus, much of the evolution of gene expression in ants may occur
    in the worker caste, despite the fact that these individuals are largely
    or completely sterile. Analyses of gene expression evolution revealed a
    combination of positive selection and relaxation of stabilizing selection
    as important factors driving the evolution of such genes.>

    <bib-field|abstract|In cooperative multiagent systems, agents interact to
    solve tasks. Global dynamics of multiagent teams result from local agent
    interactions, and are complex and difficult to predict. Evolutionary
    computation has proven a promising approach to the design of such teams.
    The majority of current studies use teams composed of agents with
    identical control rules (“geneti- cally homogeneous teams”) and
    select behavior at the team level (“team-level selection”). Here we
    extend current approaches to include four combinations of genetic team
    composition and level of selection. We compare the performance of
    genetically homo- geneous teams evolved with individual-level selection,
    genetically homogeneous teams evolved with team-level selection,
    genetically heterogeneous teams evolved with individual-level selection,
    and genetically heterogeneous teams evolved with team-level selection. We
    use a simulated foraging task to show that the optimal combination
    depends on the amount of cooperation required by the task. Accordingly,
    we distinguish between three types of cooperative tasks and suggest
    guidelines for the optimal choice of genetic team composition and level

    <bib-field|abstract|Observations of numerous dramatic and presumably
    adaptive phenotypic modifications during human evolution prompt the
    common belief that more genes have undergone positive Darwinian selection
    in the human lineage than in the chimpanzee lineage since their
    evolutionary divergence 6-7 million years ago. Here, we test this
    hypothesis by analyzing nearly 14,000 genes of humans and chimps. To
    ensure an accurate and unbiased comparison, we select a proper outgroup,
    avoid sequencing errors, and verify statistical methods. Our results show
    that the number of positively selected genes is substantially smaller in
    humans than in chimps, despite a generally higher nonsynonymous
    substitution rate in humans. These observations are explainable by the
    reduced efficacy of natural selection in humans because of their smaller
    long-term effective population size but refute the anthropocentric view
    that a grand enhancement in Darwinian selection underlies human origins.
    Although human and chimp positively selected genes have different
    molecular functions and participate in different biological processes,
    the differences do not ostensibly correspond to the widely assumed
    adaptations of these species, suggesting how little is currently known
    about which traits have been under positive selection. Our analysis of
    the identified positively selected genes lends support to the association
    between human Mendelian diseases and past adaptations but provides no
    evidence for either the chromosomal speciation hypothesis or the
    widespread brain-gene acceleration hypothesis of human origins.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The synonymous divergence between Escherichia coli
    and Salmonella typhimurium is explained in a model where there is a large
    variation between mutation rates at different nucleotide sites in the
    genome. The model is based on the experimental observation that
    spontaneous mutation rates can vary over several orders of magnitude at
    different sites in a gene. Such site-specific variation must be taken
    into account when studying synonymous divergence and will result in an
    apparent saturation below the level expected from an assumption of
    uniform rates. Recently, it has been suggested that codon preference in
    enterobacteria has a very large site-specific variation and that the
    synonymous divergence between different species, e.g., E. coli and
    Salmonella, is saturated. In the present communication it is shown that
    when site-specific variation in mutation rates is introduced, there is no
    need to invoke assumptions of saturation and a large variability in codon
    preference. The same rate variation will also bring average mutation
    rates as estimated from synonymous sequence divergence into numerical
    agreement with experimental values.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The vertebrate genome is a mosaic of GC-poor and
    GC-rich isochores, megabase-sized DNA regions of fairly homogeneous base
    composition that differ in relative amount, gene density, gene
    expression, replication timing, and recombination frequency. At the
    emergence of warm-blooded vertebrates, the gene-rich, moderately GC-rich
    isochores of the cold-blooded ancestors underwent a GC increase. This
    increase was similar in mammals and birds and was maintained during the
    evolution of mammalian and avian orders. Neither the GC increase nor its
    conservation can be accounted for by the random fixation of neutral or
    nearly neutral single-nucleotide changes (i.e., the vast majority of
    nucleotide substitutions) or by a biased gene conversion process
    occurring at random genome locations. Both phenomena can be explained,
    however, by the neoselectionist theory of genome evolution that is
    presented here. This theory fully accepts Ohta's nearly neutral view of
    point mutations but proposes in addition (i) that the AT-biased
    mutational input present in vertebrates pushes some DNA regions below a
    certain GC threshold; (ii) that these lower GC levels cause regional
    changes in chromatin structure that lead to deleterious effects on
    replication and transcription; and (iii) that the carriers of these
    changes undergo negative (purifying) selection, the final result being a
    compositional conservation of the original isochore pattern in the
    surviving population. Negative selection may also largely explain the GC
    increase accompanying the emergence of warm-blooded vertebrates. In
    conclusion, the neoselectionist theory not only provides a solution to
    the neutralist/selectionist debate but also introduces an epigenomic
    component in genome evolution.>

    <bib-field|abstract|An important challenge for human evolutionary biology
    is to understand the genetic basis of human-chimpanzee differences. One
    influential idea holds that such differences depend, to a large extent,
    on adaptive changes in gene expression. An important step in assessing
    this hypothesis involves gaining a better understanding of selective
    constraint on noncoding regions of hominid genomes. In noncoding
    sequence, functional elements are frequently small and can be separated
    by large nonfunctional regions. For this reason, constraint in hominid
    genomes is likely to be patchy. Here we use conservation in more
    distantly related mammals and amniotes as a way of identifying small
    sequence windows that are likely to be functional. We find that
    putatively functional noncoding elements defined in this manner are
    subject to significant selective constraint in hominids.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The identification of single copy orthologs in any
    group of organisms is important for functional classification and
    phylogenetic studies. The Metazoa are no exception, but only recently has
    there been a wide-enough distribution of taxa with sufficiently high
    quality sequenced genomes to gain confidence in the wide-spread single
    copy status of a gene. Here, we present a robust set of 1,126 orthologous
    groups that have been retained in single copy since the last common
    ancestor of Metazoa. Balancing genome quality and phylogenetic coverage,
    18 sequenced Metazoan genomes of high quality were used to assemble the
    orthologous groups by applying a combination of taxa-count methods and a
    novel phylogenetic procedure of pruning sub- trees from multi-gene
    families. We find that the use of the phylogenetic procedure increases
    the number of single copy orthologs by over a third, with a good
    representation from a wide range of functional categories, expression
    profiles and evolutionary rates. We use these single copy orthologs to
    assess the completeness of 24 currently published Metazoan genomes and 62
    EST datasets. The annotated genes in published genomes vary in coverage
    from 79\\% (Ciona intestinalis) to 99.8\\% (human) with an average of
    92\\%, suggesting a value for the underlying stochastic error rate in
    genome annotation, and a strategy for identifying single copy orthologs
    in larger datasets. In contrast the vast majority of EST datasets without

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: The issue of whether coelomates form a
    single clade, the Coelomata, or whether all animals that moult an
    exoskeleton (such as the coelomate arthropods and the pseudocoelomate
    nematodes) form a distinct clade, the Ecdysozoa, is the most puzzling
    issue in animal systematics and a major open-ended subject in
    evolutionary biology. Previous single-gene and genome-scale analyses
    designed to resolve the issue have produced contradictory results. Here
    we present the first genome-scale phylogenetic evidence that strongly
    supports the Ecdysozoa hypothesis. RESULTS: Through the most extensive
    phylogenetic analysis carried out to date, the complete genomes of 11
    eukaryotic species have been analyzed in order to find homologous
    sequences derived from 18 human chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis of
    datasets showing an increased adjustment to equal evolutionary rates
    between nematode and arthropod sequences produced a gradual change from
    support for Coelomata to support for Ecdysozoa. Transition between
    topologies occurred when fast-evolving sequences of Caenorhabditis
    elegans were removed. When chordate, nematode and arthropod sequences
    were constrained to fit equal evolutionary rates, the Ecdysozoa topology
    was statistically accepted whereas Coelomata was rejected. CONCLUSIONS:
    The reliability of a monophyletic group clustering arthropods and
    nematodes was unequivocally accepted in datasets where traces of the
    long-branch attraction effect were removed. This is the first
    phylogenomic evidence to strongly support the 'moulting clade'
    hypothesis.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The recent discoveries of microRNA (miRNA) genes and
    characterization of the first few target genes regulated by miRNAs in
    Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have set the stage for
    elucidation of a novel network of regulatory control. We present a
    computational method for whole-genome prediction of miRNA target genes.
    The method is validated using known examples. For each miRNA, target
    genes are selected on the basis of three properties: sequence
    complementarity using a position-weighted local alignment algorithm, free
    energies of RNA-RNA duplexes, and conservation of target sites in related
    genomes. Application to the D. melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura and
    Anopheles gambiae genomes identifies several hundred target genes
    potentially regulated by one or more known miRNAs.>

    <bib-field|abstract|We examined the pattern of nucleotide substitution in
    4933 conserved single-copy orthologous protein-coding genes of human,
    rhesus, mouse, and rat. Consistent with previous studies, the median
    ratio of the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site
    (d(N)) to the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site
    (d(S)) was significantly higher in the comparison between the two
    primates than in the comparison between the two rodents. This pattern was
    particularly strong in the case of genes expressed in the immune system,
    but also occurred in other genes, including a set of highly conserved
    genes involved in the regulation of transcription. Both synonymous and
    nonsynonymous differences occurred independently in the same codons in
    the primates and in the rodents to a greater extent than expected by
    chance, but the extent of the deviation from random expectation was much
    greater in the case of nonsynonymous differences. Parallel amino acid
    replacements occurred at the same sites in the primates and rodents far
    more frequently than expected by chance, but tended to involve very
    conservative amino acid changes. Divergent amino acid changes involved
    more chemically different amino acids than parallel changes, and
    divergent amino acid replacements between the primates were significantly
    more radical than those between the rodents. These results are most
    easily explained on the hypothesis that the evolution of these genes has
    been shaped largely by purifying selection, which has been less effective
    in primates than in rodents, presumably as a consequence of lower
    long-term effective population sizes in the former.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Investigations of rapidly evolving sex- and
    reproduction-related genes are expected to reveal important information
    about the process of speciation and species divergence. We screened
    testis, ovary, and head tissues to identify and characterize rapidly
    evolving genes (REGs) between closely related species. The results show
    differential patterns of evolution of genes expressed in reproductive and
    nonreproductive tissues. (1) There is a differential distribution of REGs
    in the Drosophila genome, with most REGs localized in the testis,
    followed by ovary, and then head. (2) Sequence analysis indicates that
    differential selective pressures are driving the rapid evolution of genes
    expressed in sex and nonsex tissues. Testis REGs from our data, on
    average, yielded higher rates of nonsynonymous substitutions relative to
    transcripts in ovary and head, indicating stronger selective pressures on
    the male reproductive system. (3) We identified REGs in the testis,
    ovary, as well as in head tissue that show evidence of evolving under
    positive selection. Identification of rapidly evolving sex genes is
    important for detailed investigations of cryptic female choice, sexual
    conflict, and faster male evolution and is pertinent to our understanding
    of the process of species divergence and speciation.>

    <bib-field|abstract|We consider the problem of biological complexity via
    a projection of protein-coding genes of complex organisms onto the
    functional space of the proteome. The latter can be defined as a set of
    all functions committed by proteins of an organism. Alternative splicing
    (AS) allows an organism to generate diverse mature RNA transcripts from a
    single mRNA strand and thus it could be one of the key mechanisms of
    increasing of functional complexity of the organism's proteome and a
    driving force of biological evolution. Thus, the projection of
    transcription units (TU) and alternative splice-variant (SV) forms onto
    proteome functional space could generate new types of relational networks
    (e.g. SV-protein function networks, SFN) and lead to discoveries of novel
    evolutionarily conservative functional modules. Such types of networks
    might provide new reliable characteristics of organism complexity and a
    better understanding of the evolutionary integration and plasticity of
    interconnection of genome-transcriptome-proteome functions. RESULTS: We
    use the InterPro and UniProt databases to attribute descriptive features
    (keywords) to protein sequences. UniProt database includes a controlled
    and curated vocabulary of specific descriptors or keywords. The keywords
    have been assigned to a protein sequence via conserved domains or via
    similarity with annotated sequences. Then we consider the unique
    combinations of keywords as the protein functional labels (FL), which
    characterize the biological functions of the given protein and construct
    the contingency tables and graphs providing the projections of
    transcription units (TU) and alternative splice-variants (SV) onto all FL
    of the proteome of a given organism. We constructed SFNs for organisms
    with different evolutionary history and levels of complexity, and
    performed detailed statistical parameterization of the networks.
    CONCLUSIONS: The application of the algorithm to organisms with different
    evolutionary history and level of biological complexity (nematode, fruit
    fly, vertebrata) reveals that the parameters describing SFN correlate
    with the complexity of a given organism. Using statistical analysis of
    the links of the functional networks, we propose new features of
    evolution of protein function acquisition. We reveal a group of genes and
    corresponding functions, which could be attributed to an early
    conservative part of the cellular machinery essential for cell viability
    and survival. We identify and provide characteristics of functional
    switches in the polyform group of TUs in different organisms. Based on
    comparison of mouse and human SFNs, a role of alternative splicing as a
    necessary source of evolution towards more complex organisms is
    demonstrated. The entire set of FL across many organisms could be used as
    a draft of the catalogue of the functional space of the proteome world.>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: Traditionally, most studies employing
    data from whole mitochondrial genomes to diagnose relationships among the
    major lineages of mammals have attempted to exclude regions that
    potentially complicate phylogenetic analysis. Components generally
    excluded are 3rd codon positions of protein-encoding genes, the control
    region, rRNAs, tRNAs, and the ND6 gene (encoded on the opposite strand).
    We present an approach that includes all the data, with the exception of
    the control region. This approach is based on a site-specific rate model
    that accommodates excessive homoplasy and that utilizes secondary
    structure as a reference for proper alignment of rRNAs and tRNAs.
    RESULTS: Mitochondrial genomic data for 78 eutherian mammals, 8
    metatherians, and 3 monotremes were analyzed with a Bayesian analysis and
    our site specific rate model. The resultant phylogeny revealed strong
    support for most nodes and was highly congruent with more recent
    phylogenies based on nuclear DNA sequences. In addition, many of the
    conflicting relationships observed by earlier mitochondrial-based
    analyses were resolved without need for the exclusion of large subsets of
    the data. CONCLUSION: Rather than exclusion of data to minimize presumed
    noise associated with non-protein encoding genes in the mitochondrial
    genome, our results indicate that selection of an appropriate model that
    accommodates rate heterogeneity across data partitions and proper
    treatment of RNA genes can result in a mitochondrial genome-based
    phylogeny of eutherian mammals that is reasonably congruent with recent
    phylogenies derived from nuclear genes.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Both positive selection and negative selection have
    been shown to drive the evolution of coding regions. It is of interest to
    know if the corresponding 5' regions of genes may be subjected to
    selection of comparable intensities. For such a comparison, we chose the
    Accessory gland protein (Acp) genes as our test case. About 700 bp and
    600 bp for the 5' and coding regions, respectively, of eight previously
    unstudied genes were sequenced from 21 isogenic lines of D. melanogaster
    and one line from D. simulans. The ratio of divergence at the amino-acid
    replacement sites (A) over that at the synonymous sites (S) was twice the
    ratio for common polymorphism. Interestingly, the 5' region shows the
    same trend, with the 5'/S divergence ratio being 1.8 times higher than
    the 5'/S ratio for common polymorphism. There are several possible
    explanations for the 5'/S ratios, including demography, negative
    selection, and positive selection. Under normal conditions, positive
    selection is the most likely explanation. If that is true, about 45 to 50
    percent of all fixed differences at both the replacement and 5' sites
    were adaptive, even though the substitution rate in the former is only
    half that of the latter (K(A)/K(S) approximately 0.3 vs. K(5')/K(S)
    approximately 0.6). As previous analyses have indicated, the inclusion of
    slightly deleterious polymorphism confounds the inference of positive
    selection. The analysis of published polymorphism data covering 97
    verified 5' regions of Drosophila suggests more pronounced selective
    constraint on the 5' untranslated region and the core promoter (together
    corresponding to approximately 200 bp in this data set) when compared to
    the more distal portion of the 5' region of genes.>

    extensive conservation of potentially biologically significant regions.
    An inverse correlation is apparent between gene copy number and the

    <bib-field|abstract|Protamines are short and highly basic sperm-specific
    nuclear proteins that replace somatic histones during spermiogenesis in a
    process that is crucial for sperm formation and function. Many mammals
    have two protamine genes (PRM1 and PRM2) located in a gene cluster which
    appears to evolve fast. Another gene in this cluster (designated as
    protamine 3, PRM3) codes for a protein that is conserved among mammals
    but which does not seem to be involved in chromatin condensation. We have
    compared protein sequences and amino acid composition of protamines in
    this gene cluster, searched for evidence of positive selection of PRM3
    and examined if sexual selection (sperm competition) may drive the
    evolution of the PRM3 gene. Nucleotide and amino acid analyses of mouse
    sequences revealed that PRM3 was very different from PRM1 and both
    precursor and mature sequences of PRM2. Among 10 mouse species, PRM3
    showed weak evidence of positive selection in two species but there was
    no clear association with levels of sperm competition. In analyses among
    mammalian species, no evidence of positive selection was found in PRM3.
    We conclude that PRM3 exhibits several clear differences with the other
    protamines and, furthermore, that it cannot be regarded as a true
    protamine.>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND:Array-based comparative genomic
    hybridization (array-CGH) is a recently developed technique for analyzing
    changes in DNA copy number. As in all microarray analyses, normalization
    is required to correct for experimental artifacts while preserving the
    true biological signal. We investigated various sources of systematic
    variation in array-CGH data and identified two distinct types of spatial
    effect of no biological relevance as the predominant experimental
    artifacts: continuous spatial gradients and local spatial bias. Local
    spatial bias affects a large proportion of arrays, and has not previously
    been considered in array-CGH experiments.RESULTS:We show that existing
    normalization techniques do not correct these spatial effects properly.
    We therefore developed an automatic method for the spatial normalization
    of array-CGH data. This method makes it possible to delineate and to
    eliminate and/or correct areas affected by spatial bias. It is based on
    the combination of a spatial segmentation algorithm called NEM
    (Neighborhood Expectation Maximization) and spatial trend estimation. We
    defined quality criteria for array-CGH data, demonstrating significant
    improvements in data quality with our method for three data sets coming
    from two different platforms (198, 175 and 26 BAC-arrays).CONCLUSION:We
    have designed an automatic algorithm for the spatial normalization of BAC
    CGH-array data, preventing the misinterpretation of experimental
    artifacts as biologically relevant outliers in the genomic profile. This

    <bib-field|abstract|Motivation: Accurate detection of positive Darwinian
    selection can provide important insights to researchers investigating the
    evolution of pathogens. However, many pathogens (particularly viruses)
    undergo frequent recombination and the phylogenetic methods commonly
    applied to detect positive selection have been shown to give misleading
    results when applied to recombining sequences. We propose a method that
    makes maximum likelihood inference of positive selection robust to the
    presence of recombination. This is achieved by allowing tree topologies
    and branch lengths to change across detected recombination breakpoints.
    Further improvements are obtained by allowing synonymous substitution
    rates to vary across sites. Results: Using simulation we show that, even
    for extreme cases where recombination causes standard methods to reach
    false positive rates \>90\\%, the proposed method decreases the false
    positive rate to acceptable levels while retaining high power. We applied
    the method to two HIV-1 datasets for which we have previously found that
    inference of positive selection is invalid owing to high rates of
    recombination. In one of these (env gene) we still detected positive
    selection using the proposed method, while in the other (gag gene) we
    found no significant evidence of positive selection. Availability: A
    HyPhy batch language implementation of the proposed methods and the HIV-1
    datasets analysed are available at http://www.cbio.uct.ac.za/pub\\_support/bioinf06.
    The HyPhy package is available at http://www.hyphy.org, and it is planned
    that the proposed methods will be included in the next distribution. RDP2

    <bib-field|abstract|Summary MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that serve
    as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression in higher
    eukaryotes. Their widespread and important role in animals is highlighted
    by recent estimates that 20\\%–30\\% of all genes are microRNA targets.
    Here, we report that a large set of genes involved in basic cellular
    processes avoid microRNA regulation due to short 3′UTRs that are
    specifically depleted of microRNA binding sites. For individual
    microRNAs, we find that coexpressed genes avoid microRNA sites, whereas
    target genes and microRNAs are preferentially expressed in neighboring
    tissues. This mutually exclusive expression argues that microRNAs confer
    accuracy to developmental gene-expression programs, thus ensuring tissue
    identity and supporting cell-lineage decisions.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Interacting proteins evolve at correlated rates,
    possibly as the result of evolutionary pressures shared by functional
    groups and/or coevolution between interacting proteins. This evolutionary
    signature can be exploited to learn more about protein networks and to
    infer functional relationships between proteins on a genome-wide scale.
    Multiple methods have been introduced that detect correlated evolution
    using amino acid distances. One assumption made by these methods is that
    the neutral rate of nucleotide substitution is uniform over time;
    however, this is unlikely and such rate heterogeneity would adversely
    affect amino acid distance methods. We explored alternative methods that
    detect correlated rates using protein-coding nucleotide sequences in
    order to better estimate the rate of nonsynonymous substitution at each
    branch (d(N)) normalized by the underlying synonymous substitution rate
    (d(S)). Our novel likelihood method, which was robust to realistic
    simulation parameters, was tested on Drosophila nuclear pore proteins,
    which form a complex with well-documented physical interactions. The
    method revealed significantly correlated evolution between nuclear pore
    proteins, where members of a stable subcomplex showed stronger
    correlations compared with those proteins that interact transiently.
    Furthermore, our likelihood approach was better able to detect correlated
    evolution among closely related species than previous methods. Hence,
    these sequence-based methods are a complementary approach for detecting
    correlated evolution and could be applied genome-wide to provide
    candidate protein-protein interactions and functional group assignments
    using just coding sequences.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The establishment of the correct conceptual framework
    is vital to any scientific discipline including cancer research.
    Influenced by hematologic cancer studies, the current cancer concept
    focuses on the stepwise patterns of progression as defined by specific
    recurrent genetic aberrations. This concept has faced a tough challenge
    as the majority of cancer cases follow non-linear patterns and display
    stochastic progression. In light of the recent discovery that genomic
    instability is directly linked to stochastic non-clonal chromosome
    aberrations (NCCAs), and that cancer progression can be characterized as
    a dynamic relationship between NCCAs and recurrent clonal chromosome
    aberrations (CCAs), we propose that the dynamics of NCCAs is a key
    element for karyotypic evolution in solid tumors. To support this
    viewpoint, we briefly discuss various basic elements responsible for
    cancer initiation and progression within an evolutionary context. We
    argue that even though stochastic changes can be detected at various
    levels of genetic organization, such as at the gene level and epigenetic
    level, it is primarily detected at the chromosomal or genome level. Thus,
    NCCA-mediated genomic variation plays a dominant role in cancer
    progression. To further illustrate the involvement of NCCA/CCA cycles in
    the pattern of cancer evolution, four cancer evolutionary models have
    been proposed based on the comparative analysis of karyotype patterns of
    various types of cancer.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Epithelial tumors commonly show complex and variable
    karyotypes that obscure the identification of general patterns of the
    karyotypic evolution. To overcome some of these problems, we previously
    systematically analyzed the accumulated cytogenetic data from individual
    tumor types by using various statistical means. In the present study, we
    compare previous results obtained for nine tumor types and perform
    several meta-analyses of data obtained from a number of epithelial
    tumors, including head and neck, kidney, bladder, breast, colorectal,
    ovarian, and lung cancer, as well as from malignant melanoma and Wilms
    tumor, with the specific aim of discovering common patterns of karyotypic
    evolution. We show that these tumors frequently develop through a hypo-
    or a hyperdiploid pathway and progress by an increasing number of
    alternative imbalances through at least two karyotypic phases, Phases I
    and II, and possibly through a third, Phase III. During Phase I, the
    karyotypes exhibited a power law distribution of both the number of
    changes per tumor and the frequency distribution at which bands were
    involved in breaks. At the transition from Phase I to Phase II/III, the
    observed power law distributions were lost, indicating a transition from
    an ordered and highly structured process to a disordered and chaotic
    pattern. The change in karyotypic orderliness at the transition from
    Phase I to Phase II/III was also shown by a drastic difference in
    karyotypic entropy.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Populations often have very complex hierarchical
    structure. Therefore, it is crucial in genetic monitoring and
    conservation biology to have a reliable estimate of the pattern of
    population subdivision. F(ST)'s for pairs of sampled localities or
    subpopulations are crucial statistics for the exploratory analysis of
    population structures, such as cluster analysis and multidimensional
    scaling. However, the estimation of F(ST) is not precise enough to
    reliably estimate the population structure and the extent of
    heterogeneity. This article proposes an empirical Bayes procedure to
    estimate locus-specific pairwise F(ST)'s. The posterior mean of the
    pairwise F(ST) can be interpreted as a shrinkage estimator, which reduces
    the variance of conventional estimators largely at the expense of a small
    bias. The global F(ST) of a population generally varies among loci in the
    genome. Our maximum-likelihood estimates of global F(ST)'s can be used as
    sufficient statistics to estimate the distribution of F(ST) in the
    genome. We demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our model by
    simulation and by an analysis of the microsatellite allele frequencies of
    the Pacific herring. The heterogeneity of the global F(ST) in the genome
    is discussed on the basis of the estimated distribution of the global
    F(ST) for the herring and examples of human single nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs).>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: Recent advances in genome sequencing
    suggest a remarkable conservation in gene content of mammalian organisms.
    The similarity in gene repertoire present in different organisms has
    increased interest in studying regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
    aimed at elucidating the differences in phenotypes. In particular, a
    proximal promoter region contains a large number of regulatory elements
    that control the expression of its downstream gene. Although many studies
    have focused on identification of these elements, a broader picture on
    the complexity of transcriptional regulation of different biological
    processes has not been addressed in mammals. The regulatory complexity
    may strongly correlate with gene function, as different evolutionary
    forces must act on the regulatory systems under different biological
    conditions. We investigate this hypothesis by comparing the conservation
    of promoters upstream of genes classified in different functional
    categories. RESULTS: By conducting a rank correlation analysis between
    functional annotation and upstream sequence alignment scores obtained by
    human-mouse and human-dog comparison, we found a significantly greater
    conservation of the upstream sequence of genes involved in development,
    cell communication, neural functions and signaling processes than those
    involved in more basic processes shared with unicellular organisms such
    as metabolism and ribosomal function. This observation persists after
    controlling for G+C content. Considering conservation as a functional
    signature, we hypothesize a higher density of cis-regulatory elements
    upstream of genes participating in complex and adaptive processes.
    CONCLUSION: We identified a class of functions that are associated with
    either high or low promoter conservation in mammals. We detected a
    significant tendency that points to complex and adaptive processes were
    associated with higher promoter conservation, despite the fact that they
    have emerged relatively recently during evolution. We described and
    contrasted several hypotheses that provide a deeper insight into how
    transcriptional complexity might have been emerged during evolution.>

    <bib-field|abstract|In angiosperms, shoot branching greatly determines
    overall plant architecture and affects fundamental aspects of plant life.
    Branching patterns are determined by genetic pathways conserved widely
    across angiosperms. In Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae, Rosidae)
    BRANCHED1 (BRC1) plays a central role in this process, acting locally to
    arrest axillary bud growth. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum, Solanaceae,
    Asteridae) we have identified two BRC1-like paralogues, SlBRC1a and
    SlBRC1b. These genes are expressed in arrested axillary buds and both are
    down-regulated upon bud activation, although SlBRC1a is transcribed at
    much lower levels than SlBRC1b. Alternative splicing of SlBRC1a renders
    two transcripts that encode two BRC1-like proteins with different C-t
    domains due to a 3'-terminal frameshift. The phenotype of
    loss-of-function lines suggests that SlBRC1b has retained the ancestral
    role of BRC1 in shoot branch suppression. We have isolated the BRC1a and
    BRC1b genes of other Solanum species and have studied their evolution
    rates across the lineages. These studies indicate that, after duplication
    of an ancestral BRC1-like gene, BRC1b genes continued to evolve under a
    strong purifying selection that was consistent with the conserved
    function of SlBRC1b in shoot branching control. In contrast, the coding
    sequences of Solanum BRC1a genes have evolved at a higher evolution rate.
    Branch-site tests indicate that this difference does not reflect
    relaxation but rather positive selective pressure for adaptation.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Changes in gene regulation likely influenced the
    profound phenotypic divergence of humans from other mammals, but the
    extent of adaptive substitution in human regulatory sequences remains
    unknown. We identified 992 conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) with a
    significant excess of human-specific substitutions. These accelerated
    elements were disproportionately found near genes involved in neuronal
    cell adhesion. To assess the uniqueness of human noncoding evolution, we
    examined CNSs accelerated in chimpanzee and mouse. Although we observed a
    similar enrichment near neuronal adhesion genes in chimpanzee, the
    accelerated CNSs themselves exhibited almost no overlap with those in
    human, suggesting independent evolution toward different neuronal
    phenotypes in each species. CNSs accelerated in mouse showed no bias
    toward neuronal cell adhesion. Our results indicate that widespread
    cis-regulatory changes in human evolution may have contributed to
    uniquely human features of brain development and function.>

    <bib-field|abstract|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22-nucleotide
    endogenous RNAs that often repress the expression of complementary
    messenger RNAs. In animals, miRNAs derive from characteristic hairpins in
    primary transcripts through two sequential RNase III-mediated cleavages;
    Drosha cleaves near the base of the stem to liberate a approximately
    60-nucleotide pre-miRNA hairpin, then Dicer cleaves near the loop to
    generate a miRNA:miRNA* duplex. From that duplex, the mature miRNA is
    incorporated into the silencing complex. Here we identify an alternative
    pathway for miRNA biogenesis, in which certain debranched introns mimic
    the structural features of pre-miRNAs to enter the miRNA-processing
    pathway without Drosha-mediated cleavage. We call these
    pre-miRNAs/introns 'mirtrons', and have identified 14 mirtrons in
    Drosophila melanogaster and another four in Caenorhabditis elegans
    (including the reclassification of mir-62). Some of these have been
    selectively maintained during evolution with patterns of sequence
    conservation suggesting important regulatory functions in the animal. The
    abundance of introns comparable in size to pre-miRNAs appears to have
    created a context favourable for the emergence of mirtrons in flies and
    nematodes. This suggests that other lineages with many similarly sized
    introns probably also have mirtrons, and that the mirtron pathway could
    have provided an early avenue for the emergence of miRNAs before the
    advent of Drosha.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Chromatin remodeling during spermiogenesis is
    characterized by a series of nuclear protein replacements. Histones are
    replaced by transition nuclear proteins, which are in turn replaced by
    protamines. The transition nuclear proteins, TP1 and TP2, and the
    protamines, PRM1 and PRM2, are the major nuclear proteins involved in
    this process. Biochemical studies of mice with null mutations in one of
    the Tnp genes showed that the absence of one TP led to an apparent
    elevation in the amount of the remaining TP in the testis. To investigate
    the mechanism of changes of protein levels and effects of one Tnp
    mutation on other nuclear proteins, we used immunohistochemistry
    techniques to determine the distribution of these nuclear proteins. In
    contrast to previous biochemical analyses, which indicated that nuclear
    protein replacement was sequential with little overlap between the
    protein types, we found considerable overlap in the nucleoprotein types
    during spermiogenesis. The TPs, which appear in the nucleus before
    histone displacement is complete, were shared among genetically
    inequivalent spermatids. The absence of one TP did not affect the time of
    appearance of the other TP or of the protamines, but it did affect the
    displacement of the other TP, leading to its abnormal retention in the
    nucleus. The elevated levels of the remaining TP in Tnp-mutant mice
    appeared to be a consequence of the prolonged retention, rather than
    increased synthesis. Thus the absence of one of the TPs did not
    significantly affect transcription or translation of the other basic
    proteins, but it did affect posttranslational events.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The neutral mutation rate is known to vary widely
    along human chromosomes, leading to mutational hot and cold regions. We
    provide evidence that categories of functionally related genes reside
    preferentially in mutationally hot or cold regions, the size of which we
    have measured. Genes in hot regions are biased toward extracellular
    communication (surface receptors, cell adhesion, immune response, etc.),
    while those in cold regions are biased toward essential cellular
    processes (gene regulation, RNA processing, protein modification, etc.).
    From a selective perspective, this organization of genes could minimize
    the mutational load on genes that need to be conserved and allow fast
    evolution for genes that must frequently adapt. We also analyze the
    effect of gene duplication and chromosomal recombination, which
    contribute significantly to these biases for certain categories of hot
    genes. Overall, our results show that genes are located nonrandomly with
    respect to hot and cold regions, offering the possibility that selection
    acts at the level of gene location in the human genome.>

    <bib-field|abstract|A key component of the ongoing ENCODE project
    involves rigorous comparative sequence analyses for the initially
    targeted 1\\% of the human genome. Here, we present orthologous sequence
    generation, alignment, and evolutionary constraint analyses of 23
    mammalian species for all ENCODE targets. Alignments were generated using
    four different methods; comparisons of these methods reveal large-scale
    consistency but substantial differences in terms of small genomic
    rearrangements, sensitivity (sequence coverage), and specificity
    (alignment accuracy). We describe the quantitative and qualitative
    trade-offs concomitant with alignment method choice and the levels of
    technical error that need to be accounted for in applications that
    require multisequence alignments. Using the generated alignments, we
    identified constrained regions using three different methods. While the
    different constraint-detecting methods are in general agreement, there
    are important discrepancies relating to both the underlying alignments
    and the specific algorithms. However, by integrating the results across
    the alignments and constraint-detecting methods, we produced constraint
    annotations that were found to be robust based on multiple independent
    measures. Analyses of these annotations illustrate that most classes of
    experimentally annotated functional elements are enriched for constrained
    sequences; however, large portions of each class (with the exception of
    protein-coding sequences) do not overlap constrained regions. The latter
    elements might not be under primary sequence constraint, might not be
    constrained across all mammals, or might have expendable molecular
    functions. Conversely, 40\\% of the constrained sequences do not overlap
    any of the functional elements that have been experimentally identified.
    Together, these findings demonstrate and quantify how many genomic
    functional elements await basic molecular characterization.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The major function of sperm is the delivery of the
    paternal genome to the metaphase II oocyte, ensuring transmission of the
    genetic information to the next generation. For successful fertilization
    and healthy offspring, sperm DNA must be protected from exogenous
    insults. This is achieved by packaging the sperm DNA into a condensed
    protamine-bound form, preceded by the precisely orchestrated removal of
    histones and intermittent insertion and removal of transition proteins.
    This remodeling process requires relaxation of supercoiled DNA by
    transient formation of physiological strand breaks that spermatids, being
    haploid, cannot repair by homologous recombination. In somatic cells, the
    presence of DNA strand breaks rapidly induces the formation of
    poly(ADP-ribose) by nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, which in turn
    facilitates DNA strand break signaling and assembly of DNA repair
    complexes. We reported earlier that chromatin remodeling steps during
    spermiogenesis trigger poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) formation. Here, we show
    that knockout mice deficient in PARP1, PARG (110-kDa isoform), or both
    display morphological and functional sperm abnormalities that are
    dependent on the individual genotypes, including residual DNA strand
    breaks associated with varying degrees of subfertility. The data
    presented highlight the importance of PAR metabolism, particularly PARG
    function, as a prerequisite of proper sperm chromatin quality.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Detecting positive Darwinian selection at the DNA
    sequence level has been a subject of considerable interest. However,
    positive selection is difficult to detect because it often operates
    episodically on a few amino acid sites, and the signal may be masked by
    negative selection. Several methods have been developed to test positive
    selection that acts on given branches (branch methods) or on a subset of
    sites (site methods). Recently, Yang, Z., and R. Nielsen (2002.
    Codon-substitution models for detecting molecular adaptation at
    individual sites along specific lineages. Mol. Biol. Evol. 19:908-917)
    developed likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) based on branch-site models to
    detect positive selection that affects a small number of sites along
    prespecified lineages. However, computer simulations suggested that the
    tests were sensitive to the model assumptions and were unable to
    distinguish between relaxation of selective constraint and positive
    selection (Zhang, J. 2004. Frequent false detection of positive selection
    by the likelihood method with branch-site models. Mol. Biol. Evol.
    21:1332-1339). Here, we describe a modified branch-site model and use it
    to construct two LRTs, called branch-site tests 1 and 2. We applied the
    new tests to reanalyze several real data sets and used computer
    simulation to examine the performance of the two tests by examining their
    false-positive rate, power, and robustness. We found that test 1 was
    unable to distinguish relaxed constraint from positive selection
    affecting the lineages of interest, while test 2 had acceptable
    false-positive rates and appeared robust against violations of model
    assumptions. As test 2 is a direct test of positive selection on the
    lineages of interest, it is referred to as the branch-site test of
    positive selection and is recommended for use in real data analysis. The
    test appeared conservative overall, but exhibited better power in
    detecting positive selection than the branch-based test. Bayes empirical
    Bayes identification of amino acid sites under positive selection along
    the foreground branches was found to be reliable, but lacked power.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Positive selection or adaptive evolution is thought
    to be responsible, at least some of the time, for the rapid accumulation
    of advantageous changes in protein-coding genes. The origin of new
    enzymatic functions, erection of barriers to heterospecific
    fertilization, and evasion of host response by pathogens, among other
    things, are thought to be instances of adaptive evolution. Detecting
    positive selection in protein-coding genes is fraught with difficulties.
    Saturation for sequence change, codon usage bias, ephemeral selection
    events and differential selective pressures on amino acids all contribute
    to the problem. A number of solutions have been proposed with varying
    degrees of success, however they suffer from limitations of not being
    accurate enough or being prohibitively computationally intensive. We have
    developed a character-based method of identifying lineages that undergo
    positive selection. In our method we assess the possibility that for each
    internal branch of a phylogenetic tree an event occurred that
    subsequently gave rise to a greater number of replacement substitutions
    than might be expected. We classify these replacement substitutions into
    two categories - whether they subsequently became invariable or changed
    again in at least one descendent lineage. The former situation indicates
    that the new character state is under strong selection to preserve its
    new identity (directional selection), while the latter situation
    indicates that there is a persistent pressure to change identity
    (non-directional selection). The method is fast and accurate, easy to
    implement, sensitive to short-lived selection events and robust with
    respect to sampling density and proportion of sites under the influence
    of positive selection.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The global decline of coral reefs highlights the need
    to understand the mechanisms that regulate community structure and
    sustain biodiversity in these systems. The neutral theory, which assumes
    that individuals are demographically identical regardless of species,
    seeks to explain ubiquitous features of community structure and
    biodiversity patterns. Here we present a test of neutral-theory
    predictions with the use of an extensive species-level data set of
    Indo-Pacific coral communities. We show that coral assemblages differ
    markedly from neutral-model predictions for patterns of community
    similarity and the relative abundance of species. Within local
    communities, neutral models do not fit relative abundance distributions
    as well as the classical log-normal distribution. Relative abundances of
    species across local communities also differ markedly from neutral-theory
    predictions: coral communities exhibit community similarity values that
    are far more variable, and lower on average, than the neutral theory can
    produce. Empirical community similarities deviate from the neutral model
    in a direction opposite to that predicted in previous critiques of the
    neutral theory. Instead, our results support spatio-temporal
    environmental stochasticity as a major driver of diversity patterns on

    <bib-field|abstract|A central task in the study of molecular evolution is
    the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree from sequences of current-day
    taxa. The most established approach to tree reconstruction is maximum
    likelihood (ML) analysis. Unfortunately, searching for the maximum
    likelihood phylogenetic tree is computationally prohibitive for large
    data sets. In this paper, we describe a new algorithm that uses
    Structural Expectation Maximization (EM) for learning maximum likelihood
    phylogenetic trees. This algorithm is similar to the standard EM method
    for edge-length estimation, except that during iterations of the
    Structural EM algorithm the topology is improved as well as the edge
    length. Our algorithm performs iterations of two steps. In the E-step, we
    use the current tree topology and edge lengths to compute expected
    sufficient statistics, which summarize the data. In the M-Step, we search
    for a topology that maximizes the likelihood with respect to these
    expected sufficient statistics. We show that searching for better
    topologies inside the M-step can be done efficiently, as opposed to
    standard methods for topology search. We prove that each iteration of
    this procedure increases the likelihood of the topology, and thus the
    procedure must converge. This convergence point, however, can be a
    suboptimal one. To escape from such "local optima," we further enhance
    our basic EM procedure by incorporating moves in the flavor of simulated
    annealing. We evaluate these new algorithms on both synthetic and real
    sequence data and show that for protein sequences even our basic
    algorithm finds more plausible trees than existing methods for searching
    maximum likelihood phylogenies. Furthermore, our algorithms are
    dramatically faster than such methods, enabling, for the first time,
    phylogenetic analysis of large protein data sets in the maximum
    likelihood framework.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The hypothesis that sperm competition should favour
    increases in sperm size, because it results in faster swimming speeds,
    has received support from studies on many taxa, but remains contentious
    for mammals. We suggest that this may be because mammalian lineages
    respond differently to sexual selection, owing to major differences in
    body size, which are associated with differences in mass-specific
    metabolic rate. Recent evidence suggests that cellular metabolic rate
    also scales with body size, so that small mammals have cells that process
    energy and resources from the environment at a faster rate. We develop
    the 'metabolic rate constraint hypothesis' which proposes that low
    mass-specific metabolic rate among large mammals may limit their ability
    to respond to sexual selection by increasing sperm size, while this
    constraint does not exist among small mammals. Here we show that among
    rodents, which have high mass-specific metabolic rates, sperm size
    increases under sperm competition, reaching the longest sperm sizes found
    in eutherian mammals. By contrast, mammalian lineages with large body
    sizes have small sperm, and while metabolic rate (corrected for body
    size) influences sperm size, sperm competition levels do not. When all
    eutherian mammals are analysed jointly, our results suggest that as
    mass-specific metabolic rate increases, so does maximum sperm size. In
    addition, species with low mass-specific metabolic rates produce
    uniformly small sperm, while species with high mass-specific metabolic
    rates produce a wide range of sperm sizes. These findings support the
    hypothesis that mass-specific metabolic rates determine the budget
    available for sperm production: at high levels, sperm size increases in
    response to sexual selection, while low levels constrain the ability to
    respond to sexual selection by increasing sperm size. Thus, adaptive and
    costly traits, such as sperm size, may only evolve under sexual selection
    when metabolic rate does not constrain cellular budgets.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The transfer of functional annotations from model
    organism proteins to human proteins is one of the main applications of
    comparative genomics. Various methods are used to analyze cross-species
    orthologous relationships according to an operational definition of
    orthology. Often the definition of orthology is incorrectly interpreted
    as a prediction of proteins that are functionally equivalent across
    species, while in fact it only defines the existence of a common ancestor
    for a gene in different species. However, it has been demonstrated that
    orthologs often reveal significant functional similarity. Therefore, the
    quality of the orthology prediction is an important factor in the
    transfer of functional annotations (and other related information). To
    identify protein pairs with the highest possible functional similarity,
    it is important to qualify ortholog identification methods.>

  <\bib-entry|article|Kondrashov2006>
    <bib-field|abstract|New genes commonly appear through complete or partial
    duplications of pre-existing genes. Duplications of long DNA segments are
    constantly produced by rare mutations, may become fixed in a population
    by selection or random drift, and are subject to divergent evolution of
    the paralogous sequences after fixation, although gene conversion can
    impede this process. New data shed some light on each of these processes.
    Mutations which involve duplications can occur through at least two
    different mechanisms, backward strand slippage during DNA replication and
    unequal crossing-over. The background rate of duplication of a complete
    gene in humans is 10(-9)-10(-10) per generation, although many genes
    located within hot-spots of large-scale mutation are duplicated much more
    often. Many gene duplications affect fitness strongly, and are
    responsible, through gene dosage effects, for a number of genetic
    diseases. However, high levels of intrapopulation polymorphism caused by
    presence or absence of long, gene-containing DNA segments imply that some
    duplications are not under strong selection. The polymorphism to fixation
    ratios appear to be approximately the same for gene duplications and for
    presumably selectively neutral nucleotide substitutions, which, according
    to the McDonald-Kreitman test, is consistent with selective neutrality of
    duplications. However, this pattern can also be due to negative selection
    against most of segregating duplications and positive selection for at
    least some duplications which become fixed. Patterns in post-fixation
    evolution of duplicated genes do not easily reveal the causes of
    fixations. Many gene duplications which became fixed recently in a
    variety of organisms were positively selected because the increased
    expression of the corresponding genes was beneficial. The effects of gene
    dosage provide a unified framework for studying all phases of the life
    history of a gene duplication. Application of well-known methods of
    evolutionary genetics to accumulating data on new, polymorphic, and fixed
    duplication will enhance our understanding of the role of natural
    selection in the evolution by gene duplication.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Babelomics is a response to the growing necessity of
    integrating and analyzing different types of genomic data in an
    environment that allows an easy functional interpretation of the results.
    Babelomics includes a complete suite of methods for the analysis of gene
    expression data that include normalization (covering most commercial
    platforms), pre-processing, differential gene expression (case-controls,
    multiclass, survival or continuous values), predictors, clustering;
    large-scale genotyping assays (case controls and TDTs, and allows
    population stratification analysis and correction). All these genomic
    data analysis facilities are integrated and connected to multiple options
    for the functional interpretation of the experiments. Different methods
    of functional enrichment or gene set enrichment can be used to understand
    the functional basis of the experiment analyzed. Many sources of
    biological information, which include functional (GO, KEGG, Biocarta,
    Reactome, etc.), regulatory (Transfac, Jaspar, ORegAnno, miRNAs, etc.),
    text-mining or protein-protein interaction modules can be used for this
    purpose. Finally a tool for the de novo functional annotation of
    sequences has been included in the system. This provides support for the
    functional analysis of non-model species. Mirrors of Babelomics or
    command line execution of their individual components are now possible.
    Babelomics is available at http://www.babelomics.org.>

    <bib-field|abstract|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous noncoding RNAs,
    which negatively regulate gene expression. To determine genomewide miRNA
    DNA copy number abnormalities in cancer, 283 known human miRNA genes were
    analyzed by high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization
    in 227 human ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma specimens. A
    high proportion of genomic loci containing miRNA genes exhibited DNA copy
    number alterations in ovarian cancer (37.1\\%), breast cancer (72.8\\%),
    and melanoma (85.9\\%), where copy number alterations observed in \>15\\%

    miRNA genes with gene copy number changes that were shared among the
    three cancer types (26 with gains and 15 with losses) as well as miRNA
    genes with copy number changes that were unique to each tumor type.
    Importantly, we show that miRNA copy changes correlate with miRNA
    expression. Finally, we identified high frequency copy number
    abnormalities of Dicer1, Argonaute2, and other miRNA-associated genes in
    breast and ovarian cancer as well as melanoma. These findings support the
    notion that copy number alterations of miRNAs and their regulatory genes
    are highly prevalent in cancer and may account partly for the frequent

    <bib-field|abstract|The African cichlids of the East-African rift-lakes
    provide one of the most dramatic examples of adaptive radiation known. It
    has long been thought that functional decoupling of the oral and
    pharyngeal jaws in cichlids has facilitated their explosive evolution.
    Recent research has also shown that craniofacial evolution from
    radiations in lakes Victoria, Malawi, and Tanganyika has occurred along a
    shared primary axis of shape divergence, whereby the preorbital region of
    the skull changes in a manner that is, relatively independent from other
    head regions. We predicted that the preorbital region would comprise a
    variational module and used an extensive dataset from each lake that
    allowed us to test this prediction using a model selection approach. Our
    findings supported the presence of a preorbital module across all lakes,
    within each lake, and for Malawi, within sand and rock-dwelling clades.
    However, while a preorbital module was consistently present, notable
    differences were also observed among groups. Of particular interest, a
    negative association between patterns of variational modularity was
    observed between the sand and rock-dwelling clades, a patter consistent
    with character displacement. These findings provide the basis for further
    experimental research involving the determination of the developmental
    and genetic bases of these patterns of modularity.>

    <bib-field|abstract|MOTIVATION: The analysis of genome-scale data from
    different high throughput techniques can be used to obtain lists of genes
    ordered according to their different behaviours under distinct
    experimental conditions corresponding to different phenotypes (e.g.
    differential gene expression between diseased samples and controls,
    different response to a drug, etc.). The order in which the genes appear
    in the list is a consequence of the biological roles that the genes play
    within the cell, which account, at molecular scale, for the macroscopic
    differences observed between the phenotypes studied. Typically, two steps
    are followed for understanding the biological processes that
    differentiate phenotypes at molecular level: first, genes with
    significant differential expression are selected on the basis of their
    experimental values and subsequently, the functional properties of these
    genes are analysed. Instead, we present a simple procedure which combines
    experimental measurements with available biological information in a way
    that genes are simultaneously tested in groups related by common
    functional properties. The method proposed constitutes a very sensitive
    tool for selecting genes with significant differential behaviour in the
    experimental conditions tested. RESULTS: We propose the use of a method
    to scan ordered lists of genes. The method allows the understanding of
    the biological processes operating at molecular level behind the
    macroscopic experiment from which the list was generated. This procedure
    can be useful in situations where it is not possible to obtain
    statistically significant differences based on the experimental
    measurements (e.g. low prevalence diseases, etc.). Two examples
    demonstrate its application in two microarray experiments and the type of
    information that can be extracted.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Protamine P2, the major basic chromosomal protein of

    the mature protein, its extra length arising from an N-terminal extension

    spermatids, and the extension is processed during chromatin condensation
    in the haploid cells. We have studied processing in the mouse and have
    identified two intermediates generated by proteolytic cleavage of the
    precursor. H.p.l.c. separated protamine P2 from four other spermatid
    proteins, including the precursor and three proteins known to possess
    physiological characteristics expected of processing intermediates.
    Peptide mapping indicated that all of these proteins were structurally
    similar. Two major proteins were further purified by PAGE, transferred to
    poly(vinylidene difluoride) membranes and submitted to automated
    N-terminal sequence analysis. Both sequences were found within the
    deduced sequence of the precursor extension. The N-terminus of the larger
    intermediate, PP2C, was Gly-12, whereas the N-terminus of the smaller,

    <bib-field|abstract|Abstract The neutral theory of biodiversity
    challenges the classical niche-based view of ecological communities,
    where species attributes and environmental conditions jointly determine
    community composition. Functional equivalence among species, as assumed
    by neutral ecological theory, has been recurrently falsified, yet many
    patterns of tropical tree communities appear consistent with neutral
    predictions. This may mean that neutral theory is a good
    first-approximation theory or that species abundance data sets contain
    too little information to reject neutrality. Here we present a simple
    test of neutrality based on species abundance distributions in ecological
    communities. Based on this test, we show that deviations from neutrality
    are more frequent than previously thought in tropical forest trees,
    especially at small spatial scales. We then develop a nonneutral model
    that generalizes Hubbell's dispersal-limited neutral model in a simple
    way by including one additional parameter of frequency dependence. We
    also develop a statistical method to infer the parameters of this model
    from empirical data by approximate Bayesian computation. In more than
    half of the permanent tree plots, we show that our new model fits the
    data better than does the neutral model. Finally, we discuss whether
    observed deviations from neutrality may be interpreted as the signature
    of environmental filtering on tropical tree species abundance

    <bib-field|abstract|The nucleotide divergence at synonymous third sites
    between two lineages will increase with time since the latest common
    ancestor, up to some saturation level. The "null-hypothesis divergence"
    is defined as the percentage of difference predicted at synonymous third
    sites, allowing for amino acid composition and codon bias, but assuming
    that codon bias is the same at all sites occupied by a given amino acid,
    when equilibrium has been reached between forward and backward
    substitutions. For two highly expressed genes, gapA and ompA, in the
    enterobacteria, the estimated values of the null-hypothesis divergence
    are 39.3 and 38.15\\%, respectively, compared to estimated values of
    saturation divergence of 19.0 and 25.4\\%. A possible explanation for
    this discrepancy is that different codons for a given amino acid are
    favored at different sites in the same gene.>

    <bib-field|abstract|There are 2 ways to infer selection pressures in the
    evolution of protein-coding genes, the nonsynonymous and synonymous
    substitution rate ratio (K(A)/K(S)) and the radical and conservative
    amino acid replacement rate ratio (K(R)/K(C)). Because the K(R)/K(C)
    ratio depends on the definition of radical and conservative changes in
    the classification of amino acids, we develop an amino acid
    classification that maximizes the correlation between K(A)/K(S) and
    K(R)/K(C). An analysis of 3,375 orthologous gene groups among 5 mammalian
    species shows that our classification gives a significantly higher
    correlation coefficient between the 2 ratios than those of existing
    classifications. However, there are many orthologous gene groups with a
    low K(A)/K(S) but a high K(R)/K(C) ratio. Examining the functions of
    these genes, we found an overrepresentation of functional categories
    related to development. To determine if the overrepresentation is stage
    specific, we examined the expression patterns of these genes at different
    developmental stages of the mouse. Interestingly, these genes are highly
    expressed in the early middle stage of development (blastocyst to
    amnion). It is commonly thought that developmental genes tend to be
    conservative in evolution, but some molecular changes in developmental
    stages should have contributed to morphological divergence in adult
    mammals. Therefore, we propose that the relaxed pressures indicated by
    the K(R)/K(C) ratio but not by K(A)/K(S) in the early middle stage of
    development may be important for the morphological divergence of mammals
    at the adult stage, whereas purifying selection detected by K(A)/K(S)
    occurs in the early middle developmental stage.>

    <bib-field|abstract|A grand challenge in the post-genomic era is a
    complete computer representation of the cell and the organism, which will
    enable computational prediction of higher-level complexity of cellular
    processes and organism behavior from genomic information. Toward this end
    we have been developing a knowledge-based approach for network
    prediction, which is to predict, given a complete set of genes in the
    genome, the protein interaction networks that are responsible for various
    cellular processes. KEGG at http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/ is the
    reference knowledge base that integrates current knowledge on molecular
    interaction networks such as pathways and complexes (PATHWAY database),
    information about genes and proteins generated by genome projects
    (GENES/SSDB/KO databases) and information about biochemical compounds and
    reactions (COMPOUND/GLYCAN/REACTION databases). These three types of
    database actually represent three graph objects, called the protein
    network, the gene universe and the chemical universe. New efforts are
    being made to abstract knowledge, both computationally and manually,
    about ortholog clusters in the KO (KEGG Orthology) database, and to
    collect and analyze carbohydrate structures in the GLYCAN database.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Coevolution maintains interactions between phenotypic
    traits through the process of reciprocal natural selection. Detecting
    molecular coevolution can expose functional interactions between
    molecules in the cell, generating insights into biological processes,
    pathways, and the networks of interactions important for cellular
    function. Prediction of interaction partners from different protein
    families exploits the property that interacting proteins can follow
    similar patterns and relative rates of evolution. Current methods for
    detecting coevolution based on the similarity of phylogenetic trees or
    evolutionary distance matrices have, however, been limited by requiring
    coevolution over the entire evolutionary history considered and are
    inaccurate in the presence of paralogous copies. We present a novel
    method for determining coevolving protein partners by finding the largest
    common submatrix in a given pair of distance matrices, with the size of
    the largest common submatrix measuring the strength of coevolution. This
    approach permits us to consider matrices of different size and scale, to
    find lineage-specific coevolution, and to predict multiple interaction
    partners. We used MatrixMatchMaker to predict protein-protein
    interactions in the human genome. We show that proteins that are known to
    interact physically are more strongly coevolving than proteins that
    simply belong to the same biochemical pathway. The human coevolution
    network is highly connected, suggesting many more protein-protein
    interactions than are currently known from high-throughput and other
    experimental evidence. These most strongly coevolving proteins suggest
    interactions that have been maintained over long periods of evolutionary
    time, and that are thus likely to be of fundamental importance to
    cellular function.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The regulation of transcriptional initiation in the
    human genome is a critical component of global gene regulation, but a
    complete catalog of human promoters currently does not exist. In order to
    identify regulatory regions, we developed four computational methods to
    integrate 129 sets of ENCODE-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation data.
    They collectively predicted 1393 regions. Roughly 47\\% of the regions
    were unique to one method, as each method makes different assumptions
    about the data. Overall, predicted regions tend to localize to highly
    conserved, DNase I hypersensitive, and actively transcribed regions in
    the genome. Interestingly, a significant portion of the regions overlaps
    with annotated 3'-UTRs, suggesting that some of them might regulate
    anti-sense transcription. The majority of the predicted regions are \>2
    kb away from the 5'-ends of previously annotated human cDNAs and hence
    are novel. These novel regions may regulate unannotated transcripts or
    may represent new alternative transcription start sites of known genes.
    We tested 163 such regions for promoter activity in four cell lines using
    transient transfection assays, and 25\\% of them showed transcriptional
    activity above background in at least one cell line. We also performed
    5'-RACE experiments on 62 novel regions, and 76\\% of the regions were
    associated with the 5'-ends of at least two RACE products. Our results

    <bib-field|abstract|As perceived by Darwin, evolutionary adaptation by
    the processes of mutation and selection is difficult to understand for
    complex features that are the product of numerous traits acting in
    concert, for example the eye or the apparatus of flight. Typically,
    mutations simultaneously affect multiple phenotypic characters. This
    phenomenon is known as pleiotropy. The impact of pleiotropy on evolution
    has for decades been the subject of formal analysis1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Some
    authors have suggested that pleiotropy can impede evolutionary progress
    (a so-called 'cost of complexity'5). The plausibility of various
    phenomena attributed to pleiotropy depends on how many traits are
    affected by each mutation and on our understanding of the correlation
    between the number of traits affected by each gene substitution and the
    size of mutational effects on individual traits. Here we show, by
    studying pleiotropy in mice with the use of quantitative trait loci
    (QTLs) affecting skeletal characters, that most QTLs affect a relatively
    small subset of traits and that a substitution at a QTL has an effect on
    each trait that increases with the total number of traits affected. This
    suggests that evolution of higher organisms does not suffer a 'cost of
    complexity' because most mutations affect few traits and the size of the
    effects does not decrease with pleiotropy.>

    species and sperm competition is thought to be a major factor influencing
    this variation. However, the functional significance of many sperm traits
    is still poorly understood. The sperm of most murid rodents are
    characterised by an apical hook of the sperm head that varies markedly in
    extent across species. In the European woodmouse Apodemus sylvaticus
    (Muridae), the highly reflected apical hook of sperm is used to form
    sperm groups, or "trains," which exhibited increased swimming velocity
    and thrusting force compared to individual sperm. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
    FINDINGS: Here we use a comparative study of murine rodent sperm and
    demonstrate that the apical hook and sperm cooperation are likely to be
    general adaptations to sperm competition in rodents. We found that
    species with relatively larger testes, and therefore more intense sperm
    competition, have a longer, more reflected apical sperm hook. In
    addition, we show that sperm groups also occur in rodents other than the
    European woodmouse. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that in rodents
    sperm cooperation is more widespread than assumed so far and highlight
    the importance of diploid versus haploid selection in the evolution of
    sperm design and function.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Discovered just over a decade ago, microRNA (miRNA)
    is now recognized as one of the major regulatory gene families in
    eukaryotic cells. Hundreds of miRNAs have been found in animals, plants
    and viruses, and there are certainly more to come. Through specific
    base-pairing with mRNAs, these tiny approximately 22-nt RNAs induce mRNA
    degradation or translational repression, or both. Because a miRNA can
    target numerous mRNAs, often in combination with other miRNAs, miRNAs
    operate highly complex regulatory networks. In this article, we summarize
    the current status of miRNA gene mining and miRNA expression profiling.
    We also review up-to-date knowledge of miRNA gene structure and the
    biogenesis mechanism. Our focus is on animal miRNAs.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Comparisons of DNA polymorphism within species to
    divergence between species enables the discovery of molecular adaptation
    in evolutionarily constrained genes as well as the differentiation of
    weak from strong purifying selection1, 2, 3, 4. The extent to which weak
    negative and positive darwinian selection have driven the molecular
    evolution of different species varies greatly5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
    13, 14, 15, 16, with some species, such as Drosophila melanogaster,
    showing strong evidence of pervasive positive selection6, 7, 8, 9, and
    others, such as the selfing weed Arabidopsis thaliana, showing an excess
    of deleterious variation within local populations9, 10. Here we contrast
    patterns of coding sequence polymorphism identified by direct sequencing
    of 39 humans for over 11,000 genes to divergence between humans and
    chimpanzees, and find strong evidence that natural selection has shaped
    the recent molecular evolution of our species. Our analysis discovered
    304 (9.0\\%) out of 3,377 potentially informative loci showing evidence
    of rapid amino acid evolution. Furthermore, 813 (13.5\\%) out of 6,033
    potentially informative loci show a paucity of amino acid differences
    between humans and chimpanzees, indicating weak negative selection and/or
    balancing selection operating on mutations at these loci. We find that
    the distribution of negatively and positively selected genes varies
    greatly among biological processes and molecular functions, and that some
    classes, such as transcription factors, show an excess of rapidly
    evolving genes, whereas others, such as cytoskeletal proteins, show an
    excess of genes with extensive amino acid polymorphism within humans and
    yet little amino acid divergence between humans and chimpanzees.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Comparisons of orthologous genomic DNA sequences can
    be used to characterize regions that have been subject to purifying
    selection and are enriched for functional elements. We here present the
    results of such an analysis on an alignment of sequences from 29
    mammalian species. The alignment captures approximately 3.9 neutral
    substitutions per site and spans approximately 1.9 Mbp of the human
    genome. We identify constrained elements from 3 bp to over 1 kbp in
    length, covering approximately 5.5\\% of the human locus. Our estimate
    for the total amount of nonexonic constraint experienced by this locus is
    roughly twice that for exonic constraint. Constrained elements tend to
    cluster, and we identify large constrained regions that correspond well
    with known functional elements. While constraint density inversely
    correlates with mobile element density, we also show the presence of
    unambiguously constrained elements overlapping mammalian ancestral
    repeats. In addition, we describe a number of elements in this region
    that have undergone intense purifying selection throughout mammalian
    evolution, and we show that these important elements are more numerous
    than previously thought. These results were obtained with Genomic
    Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP), a statistically rigorous and
    biologically transparent framework for constrained element
    identification. GERP identifies regions at high resolution that exhibit
    nucleotide substitution deficits, and measures these deficits as
    "rejected substitutions". Rejected substitutions reflect the intensity of
    past purifying selection and are used to rank and characterize
    constrained elements. We anticipate that GERP and the types of analyses
    it facilitates will provide further insights and improved annotation for
    the human genome as mammalian genome sequence data become richer.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Development of the animal body plan is controlled by
    large gene regulatory networks (GRNs), and hence evolution of body plans
    must depend upon change in the architecture of developmental GRNs.
    However, these networks are composed of diverse components that evolve at
    different rates and in different ways. Because of the hierarchical
    organization of developmental GRNs, some kinds of change affect terminal
    properties of the body plan such as occur in speciation, whereas others
    affect major aspects of body plan morphology. A notable feature of the
    paleontological record of animal evolution is the establishment by the
    Early "Cambrian of virtually all phylum-level body plans. We identify a
    class of GRN component, the kernels" of the network, which, because of
    their developmental role and their particular internal structure, are
    most impervious to change. Conservation of phyletic body plans may have
    been due to the retention since pre-Cambrian time of GRN kernels, which
    underlie development of major body parts.>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: Genomic DNA copy number aberrations are
    frequent in solid tumors, although the underlying causes of chromosomal
    instability in tumors remain obscure. Genes likely to have genomic
    instability phenotypes when mutated (e.g. those involved in mitosis,
    replication, repair, and telomeres) are rarely mutated in chromosomally
    unstable sporadic tumors, even though such mutations are associated with
    some heritable cancer prone syndromes. METHODS: We applied array
    comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to the analysis of breast tumors.
    The variation in the levels of genomic instability amongst tumors
    prompted us to investigate whether alterations in processes/genes
    involved in maintenance and/or manipulation of the genome were associated
    with particular types of genomic instability. RESULTS: We discriminated
    three breast tumor subtypes based on genomic DNA copy number alterations.
    The subtypes varied with respect to level of genomic instability. We find
    that shorter telomeres and altered telomere related gene expression are
    associated with amplification, implicating telomere attrition as a
    promoter of this type of aberration in breast cancer. On the other hand,
    the numbers of chromosomal alterations, particularly low level changes,
    are associated with altered expression of genes in other functional
    classes (mitosis, cell cycle, DNA replication and repair). Further,
    although loss of function instability phenotypes have been demonstrated
    for many of the genes in model systems, we observed enhanced expression
    of most genes in tumors, indicating that over expression, rather than
    deficiency underlies instability. CONCLUSION: Many of the genes
    associated with higher frequency of copy number aberrations are direct
    targets of E2F, supporting the hypothesis that deregulation of the Rb
    pathway is a major contributor to chromosomal instability in breast
    tumors. These observations are consistent with failure to find mutations
    in sporadic tumors in genes that have roles in maintenance or
    manipulation of the genome.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Sperm competition is now recognised as a potent
    selective force shaping many male reproductive traits. While the
    influence of sperm competition on sperm number is widely accepted, its
    effects upon sperm size remain controversial. It had been traditionally
    assumed that there is a trade-off between sperm number and sperm size, so
    that an increase in sperm number would result in a decrease in sperm
    size, under conditions of sperm competition. Contrary to this prediction,
    we proposed some time ago that sperm competition favours an increase in
    sperm size, because longer sperm swim faster and are more likely to win
    the race to fertilize ova. Comparative studies between species show that
    in many taxa such a relationship exists, but the consequences of an
    increase in sperm size may vary between taxa depending on the environment
    in which spermatozoa have to compete. We present new evidence showing
    that in mammals longer sperm swim at higher speeds. We also show that
    mean swimming speed is highly correlated with maximum swimming speed, so
    even if the fastest swimming sperm are more likely to fertilize, both
    measures are informative. When individuals of the same species are
    compared, ratios between the dimensions of different sperm components, as
    well as the shape of the head, seem better at explaining sperm swimming
    velocity. Finally, we show that mean and maximum sperm swimming speed
    determine male fertility. Other studies have shown that in competitive
    contexts, males with faster swimming sperm have higher fertilization
    success. We conclude that the available evidence supports our original
    hypothesis.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Sperm-egg interaction is a crucial step in
    fertilization, yet the identity of most interacting sperm-egg proteins
    that mediate this process remains elusive. Rapid evolution of some
    fertilization proteins has been observed in a number of species,
    including evidence of positive selection in the evolution of components
    of the mammalian egg coat. The rapid evolution of the egg-coat proteins
    could strongly select for changes on the sperm receptor, to maintain the
    interaction. Here, we present evidence that positive selection has driven
    the evolution of PKDREJ, a candidate sperm receptor of mammalian egg-coat
    proteins. We sequenced PKDREJ from a panel of 14 primates, including
    humans, and conducted a comparative maximum-likelihood analysis of
    nucleotide changes and found evidence of positive selection. An
    additional panel of 48 humans was surveyed for nucleotide polymorphisms
    at the PKDREJ locus. The regions predicted to have been subject to
    adaptive evolution among primates show several amino acid polymorphisms
    within humans. The distribution of polymorphisms suggests that balancing
    selection may maintain diverse PKDREJ alleles in some populations. It
    remains unknown whether there are functional differences associated with
    these diverse alleles, but their existence could have consequences for
    human fertility.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Changes in non-protein-coding regulatory DNA
    sequences have been proposed to play distinctive roles in adaptive
    evolution. We analyzed correlations between gene functions and evidence
    for positive selection in a common statistical framework across several
    large surveys of coding and noncoding sequences throughout the human
    genome. Strong correlations with both classifications in gene ontologies
    and measurements of gene expression indicate that neural development and
    function have adapted mainly through noncoding changes. In contrast,
    adaptation via coding changes is dominated by immunity, olfaction, and
    male reproduction. Genes with highly tissue-specific expression have
    undergone more adaptive coding changes, suggesting that pleiotropic
    constraints inhibit such changes in broadly expressed genes. In contrast,
    adaptive noncoding changes do not exhibit this pattern. Our findings
    underscore the probable importance of noncoding changes in the evolution
    of human traits, particularly cognitive traits.>

    <bib-field|abstract|BACKGROUND: Many bioinformatics analyses, ranging
    from gene clustering to phylogenetics, produce hierarchical trees as
    their main result. These are used to represent the relationships among
    different biological entities, thus facilitating their analysis and
    interpretation. A number of standalone programs are available that focus
    on tree visualization or that perform specific analyses on them. However,
    such applications are rarely suitable for large-scale surveys, in which a
    higher level of automation is required. Currently, many genome-wide
    analyses rely on tree-like data representation and hence there is a
    growing need for scalable tools to handle tree structures at large scale.
    RESULTS: Here we present the Environment for Tree Exploration (ETE), a
    python programming toolkit that assists in the automated manipulation,
    analysis and visualization of hierarchical trees. ETE libraries provide a
    broad set of tree handling options as well as specific methods to analyze
    phylogenetic and clustering trees. Among other features, ETE allows for
    the independent analysis of tree partitions, has support for the extended
    newick format, provides an integrated node annotation system and permits
    to link trees to external data such as multiple sequence alignments or
    numerical arrays. In addition, ETE implements a number of built-in
    analytical tools, including phylogeny-based orthology prediction and
    cluster validation techniques. Finally, ETE's programmable tree drawing
    engine can be used to automate the graphical rendering of trees with
    customized node-specific visualizations. CONCLUSIONS: ETE provides a
    complete set of methods to manipulate tree data structures that extends
    current functionality in other bioinformatic toolkits of a more general
    purpose. ETE is free software and can be downloaded from
    http://ete.cgenomics.org.>

    <bib-field|abstract|Sequencing DNA from several organisms has revealed
    that duplication and drift of existing genes have primarily moulded the
    contents of a given genome. Though the effect of knocking out or
    overexpressing a particular gene has been studied in many organisms, no
    study has systematically explored the effect of adding new links in a
    biological network. To explore network evolvability, we constructed 598
    recombinations of promoters (including regulatory regions) with different
    transcription or sigma-factor genes in Escherichia coli, added over a
    wild-type genetic background. Here we show that approximately 95\\% of
    new networks are tolerated by the bacteria, that very few alter growth,
    and that expression level correlates with factor position in the
    wild-type network hierarchy. Most importantly, we find that certain
    networks consistently survive over the wild type under various selection
    pressures. Therefore new links in the network are rarely a barrier for
    evolution and can even confer a fitness advantage.>

    <bib-field|abstract|The increase in the number of large data sets and the
    complexity of current probabilistic sequence evolution models
    necessitates fast and reliable phylogeny reconstruction methods. We
    describe a new approach, based on the maximum- likelihood principle,
    which clearly satisfies these requirements. The core of this method is a
    simple hill-climbing algorithm that adjusts tree topology and branch
    lengths simultaneously. This algorithm starts from an initial tree built
    by a fast distance-based method and modifies this tree to improve its
    likelihood at each iteration. Due to this simultaneous adjustment of the
    topology and branch lengths, only a few iterations are sufficient to
    reach an optimum. We used extensive and realistic computer simulations to
    show that the topological accuracy of this new method is at least as high
    as that of the existing maximum-likelihood programs and much higher than
    the performance of distance-based and parsimony approaches. The reduction
    of computing time is dramatic in comparison with other maximum-likelihood
    packages, while the likelihood maximization ability tends to be higher.
    For example, only 12 min were required on a standard personal computer to
    analyze a data set consisting of 500 rbcL sequences with 1,428 base pairs
    from plant plastids, thus reaching a speed of the same order as some
    popular distance-based and parsimony algorithms. This new method is
    implemented in the PHYML program, which is freely available on our web
    page: http://www.lirmm.fr/w3ifa/MAAS/.>
